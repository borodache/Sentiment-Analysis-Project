              " {'guid': 15, 'text_a': 'It doesn\\'t make any sense.  How can this game be considered a classic?  It has WAY too many flaws for people to continue naming it \"best game of all-time\" or \"best Castlevania game you\\'ll ever play\".\\nI don\\'t think so.  If you want a \"real\" Castlevania game, go play Castlevania 64 for the N64.  That\\'s how a Castlevania game should be done.  Not like Symphony Of The Night, which is basically a complete disaster with its many inexplicable problems.\\nDon\\'t believe me?  You will soon enough.  First and foremost, Konami must think all Castlevania fans are forgetful and dumb.  You see, the game begins with you playing as Richter, and you\\'re back in the final stage of the previous Castlevania game fighting Dracula.  This is ridiculous.  I don\\'t want to play THAT game, I want to play Symphony Of The Night.  You don\\'t have to redo the final fight with Wart in the beginning of Super Mario Bros. 3.  So you shouldn\\'t have to start off Symphony Of The Night by going back and fighting the final boss in the previous game.  What the hell is wrong with Konami?  This whole Richter/Dracula thing should have been removed.\\nAfter that\\'s over, the REAL game begins, but unfortunately that\\'s not true.  It doesn\\'t begin yet.  Immediately a screen is shown of Alucard running to the castle (which you unfortunately have no control over).  Once he\\'s inside and the gate closes, you can now play as him, but wait a minute.  There\\'s no music playing in the background.  A game can\\'t really start if there\\'s no music, because the absence of music makes a game feel empty and unexciting.\\nLuckily, my worst fear didn\\'t come true (that Konami forgot to put music in the game) and you just have to move forward a few steps and battle a few more foes before the music kicks in.  It\\'s about time!  You had me worried there!\\nBut then more problems arise.  In the same little area where the music kicks in, you encounter these zombies that come out of the ground and walk towards you, and many times you never see these zombies coming until it\\'s too late and you take a hit.  Pesky little things like this are just one of many reasons this game is almost completely unbearable.\\nEventually you meet up with a young lady named Maria.  She\\'s extremely attractive, and knows just how to push the right flirting buttons.  And that\\'s a big problem.  The way she seems to come on to Alucard and practically drool all over him is such a turn-on to the player that it\\'s very difficult to move forward and continue on with the quest.  After a Maria encounter, you can\\'t stop thinking about her beautiful pale face, those big beautiful eyes, that smooth relaxing voice, and so then what happens after that is, when you are in the middle of a serious battle, you almost always die because you can\\'t stop thinking about Maria\\'s beautiful face.\\nKonami must not understand that mostly boys play video games.  I shouldn\\'t have to say it, but I think it\\'s obvious that the creators of Maria are disappointed in themselves for creating such a good-looking woman, because one look at Maria distracts boys everywhere.  They shouldn\\'t have made her look so pretty.  Because of this, only the strongest male gamers will be able to complete this Castlevania adventure.  Had she been less attractive, guys would be able to better concentrate on the game.\\nYou\\'re probably thinking by now \"Alright, talk about the actual GAME!\"  Okay, I will, but you won\\'t like what I have to say.  It\\'s just really painful for me to pick out all the problems in this supposed classic.  Basically, it all boils down to one thing.  The fact that some weapons in this game are incredibly slow, weak and almost useless.  Yes, I\\'m talking about the Jewel Sword and the Sword Of Hador.  Konami never should have put these two weapons in the game.  But because they did, we have no choice but to put up with them, and I have no choice but to complain.  These two weapons really drag the game down.\\nI could go on and on about the many problems you will see in this game.  Twice in the game you will have to fight a guy who looks exactly like you, which if you ask me, lacks creativity.  Konami wasted a good opportunity right there to come up with new and exciting bosses to fight, but no, they had to go with the old predictable mirror match.\\nMany enemies have blood fiercely squirting out of their bodies when you attack them, forcing me and my children to look away from the TV screen.  Because me and my children understand that if we look at the screen and see this violence, we will throw up all over ourselves and even worse, we might even have trouble making it through the day without screaming in fear that the same brutal treatment might happen to us if we\\'re not careful.  A little bit of blood is fine, but some of the blood in Symphony Of The Night is a bit too graphic and plentiful.  It\\'s enough to terrorize you.  So the best thing to do would be to try and jump over these bloody enemies so you won\\'t have to attack them, though in many places, avoiding enemies won\\'t be easy.\\nFinally, the biggest problem.  The second castle in the game is just the first castle turned upside down, so it\\'s not really a new castle.  Now that\\'s what I call clumsy.  Between the smutty actions of Maria and the blood all over the place, it feels like I\\'m watching a porno blood fest.  Not a pretty thought, is it?  So as you can see, many problems prevent this game from being a classic.  Don\\'t even think about buying it.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 'negative'},\n",

First off let me say that if you are buying this game and expecting an MLB The Show type gaming experience you are a moron!  You should know this before buying it.  I am a baseball junkie and i was also a big fan of the RBI baseball series growing up as a kid on my nes and genesis.  While I already own and love MLB The Show 15 already,  I wanted another baseball option to add to my library and for about 20 bucks I gave RBI 16 a shot.  At first it seemed a lil difficult playing against the computer but after adjusting the difficulty to 'easy' and playing 3-4 games in a row, I got the hang of it and playing became more simple!  When batting just like in real baseball you have to hit the ball on the sweet part of the bat if you want it to go far so once you figure out where the computer will probably throw the next pitch you can move your batter to stand in the right spot for a sure hit and/or homerun!  As far as pitching you have a fastball and an offspeed pitch.  All you have to do is paint the corners inside and outside and you can fool the computer fairly easily and rack up strikeouts.  Most games I hit multiple homeruns and usually score 7+ runs a game against the computer.  You can play a shortened season or a full 162 game season and you can simulate games you don't feel like playing.  It keeps track of your player's stats for you baseball stat geeks as the season moves along.  The stadiums all look correct for each city.  For the money I spent I actually enjoy this game!!  It's an enjoyable arcade baseball game and fun to play when you just wanna play a quick baseball game!\\n\\n This is not meant to be a super realistic game,  it is meant to be an arcade style baseball game with simple controls and gameplay.\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 'neutral'},\n",
              " {'guid': 28, 'text_a': 'The Evil Dead films have--with good reason--a dedicated fan following, and a video game tie-in seemed like a logical choice. If you like the films, then you will probably like this game. Bruce Campbell returns as Ash, the Boomstick-slinging, chainsaw-wielding hero of the films with an axe to grind (literally) and Deadites to kill. The premise is very simple: Armed with his trusty chainsaw, Boomstick, spells, and a quip-spouting mouth, Ash must must travel through time to various points in Dearborn, Michigan\\'s past and accomplish certain goals that will stop the Deadites from overrunning the Earth.\\nThe Good: Action, action, action. Deadites are everywhere, constantly on the attack. Bruce Campbell has a number of great one-liners, and his vocal work and self-deprecating humor makes the more tedious parts of the game pass more easily. The game has an Mature rating, and with good reason: Ash hacks Deadites apart with his chainsaw, sending limbs and heads flying everywhere and blood spurting ten feet into the air. He blasts them into a fine red mist with his shotgun, and cooks them with his flamethrower. Definitely not a game for the kiddies. Controls are decent, though Ash seems to have trouble outrunning Deadites, who shamble and shuffle along. I especially like the two-handed attacks Ash can execute, such as using the chainsaw and shotgun simultaneously. You can also cast spells, such as \"Possess Deadite\" and a great lightning spell that add to your arsenal and allow you to work through some areas more easily.\\nThe Bad: Constant Deadite regeneration. Just when you think you\\'ve cleared an area of Deadites, they respawn. This makes backtracking very, very difficult, as enemies keep respawning every time you pass through an area. This makes game progression difficult at times. Also, there never seems to enough health. I\\'ve killed literally dozens of Deadites and only been rewarded with one or two bits of health.\\nThere are also too many cutscenes, and most of them cannot be skipped. it\\'s annoying to face a boss character, get killed, and have to sit through the introductory clip again and again without being able to skip it. There are also too few save points. Constantly replaying the same areas again and again gets old after a while.\\nGraphics are subpar, but Ash at least LOOKS like Bruce Campbell, and the blood and atmospheric effects are adequate. The camera angle can be a real aggravation at times. I had to rotate it way too often to get my bearings, a problem commonly found in third-person games.\\nThe Ugly: The Deadites. Nuff said.\\nA tip or two: Save devastating weapons, such as explosive shells, armor-piercing bullets, or the flamethrower for crowds of Deadites. When faced with that many enemies, your trusty chainsaw won\\'t be able to mow them down fast enough to keep you from being surrounded. Single Deadites are usually best dispatched with your chainsaw. Also, when the music begins to quicken, that\\'s a hint that Deadites are approaching. The game also has some good unlockable arcade levels, usually accessed by killing X number of Deadites in X amount of time.\\nNot a perfect game by any means, but for twenty bucks or so, a pretty worthy purchase.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 'neutral'},\n",

Sure they're hard to get used to but they open up a lot more options for bombing runs, dogfights, etc.  There are legitimate gripes about this game: word-for-word banter from Star Fox 64, copied planet layout, and clumsy controls. That being said, the motion control set up does not make this a 1-star game as many people are posting.\\n\\nIt's not hard to move the aiming reticule while flying the Arwing (although precision is difficult) so there's less looking back-and-forth than I expected.  The BIGGEST and legitimate problem with the whole set up is that the lasers don't shoot where the reticule aims, there's some weird POV trajectory they take.

The barebones essentials to make almost any FPS great.\\n\\nI have grown extremely tired of the Call of Duty/ battlefield/ Halo debates. Gamers have become quite cruel to each other when it comes to these games and they seem to worship these games like they are their holy grail of shooters. I myself miss the days when a new FPS was coming out and EVERYONE was excited about it. There were no flame wars about which game was better or whose graphics were just a bit better, people just wanted to have a good time. Isn\\'t that what games are supposed to be about? I guess I am just a wishful thinker, I better get to the point here.\\n\\nBodycount throws everything about modern day shooters out the window and I am 100% ok with that idea. This game is all about pure arcade action! Think about the game as a modern day Metal Slug and you will understand what the guys at Codemasters were trying to achieve. Even the ammo and intel pickups you recieve from killing baddies make arcade-like sounds when you pick them up. The game has next to no story, but thats fine with me, in fact im GLAD there isn\\'t a shoddy attempt at a \"story\" because the most popular FPS games these days have poor excuses for stories anyway. At least codemasters had the dignity to just focus mainly on the gunplay and not waste their time on a story that no one would care about, I play most FPS games for the gameplay only ( except for a few good ones like bioshock, half-life,etc. )\\n\\nThe graphics are good, they are no Crysis 2, but they get the job done and the game is still very enjoyable. Guns looks great and sound great too. There are plenty of explosions and it will be hard for you to run out of ammo. When you kill baddies they drop orbs that fill your ammo and your special skill slots. Skills include, explosive bullets and even an airstrike! Just know that this game was not aiming for much realism and you will have a great time!\\n\\nHere is where people are gonna whine about this game, when you \"aim down the sites\" of your gun, the camera jusy zooms in on your target reticule...just like the old days of shooters! Remember when \"iron sites\" didn\\'t exist? Games like Timesplitters 2 and Black were fantastic games, and they didn\\'t have iron sights. It may take awhile to get used to, but this aiming system is still awesome. Which brings me to point #2. When you pull the left trigger all the way, you can\\'t move your character withthe left stick anymore. You go into a manual cover mode where you can dodge in any direction, which is quite awesome and inventive. Do not fret though, you can still aim and move if you only pull the left trigger half way down. Its a new control scheme and its nice to see something new.\\n\\nBasically, there is not much more to this game that I can tell you about. There isn\\'t much of a story and the gameplay is solid. The guns look and feel great, and the action never stops. If you are looking for a game that embraces the FPS style of yesteryear, then do not overlook Bodycount!\\n\\nNew: I see the big time reviewers already bashing this game for lack of story and simple multiplayer. Even Official Xbox Magazine said that you can only strafe while aiming down the sites, obviously they didn\\'t take the time to even play the game because you can move around with the trigger half pulled.

I hadn\\'t heard of it til GS posted their review. I heard great things about it and had extra money so I went out and purchased it. It was one of the best blind buys I have ever made.\\n\\nFrom the opening scene I was drawn into this world. It is one that we have rarely scene: it is beautiful, but I\\'ll get to that later on. The storyline is very simple: driven by revenge, Kratos (the \"hero\" of our tale) embarks on an epic journey to bring down Ares, the God of War. There is more to it than that but you need to play this game in order to truly appreciate it. I won\\'t ruin anything here.\\n\\nGraphics. This is one of the best looking games of this generation. Period. Second only to, IMO, Metal Gear Solid (I\\'m talking consoles, not PC games remember). Everything is just gorgeous. The characters move ever so fluidly. The character models are great to look at. Some of course are less detailed than others but its easily able to overlook these as you\\'ll be caught up in everything else. The locales are beautiful. More than once you\\'ll stop and just looks around and take everything in. This also leads me into the art of the game. The art direction is fantastic. There are normal cutscenes and there are the different ones (you\\'ll know these). The art direction in these different scenes are simply captivating. The style of art used is one of which I myself have never witnessed in a game before. The characters and environments are 2D but are treated as 3D. It\\'s elegant really. A sight to behold. The worlds look wonderful as well. Everything is so lush and beautiful, just like Greece is made out to be. Everything is detailed down to the last rock or brick (or whatever they used back then). No detail is too small, which is quite commendable.\\n\\nThe sound in this game is again, IMO, second only to MGS3. The music in this is comparable to that of a big budget Hollywood production. Everything music-wise fits perfectly with the situation at hand. Sometimes it is quite subtle too as to where you don\\'t directly notice it but sets the mood and would hamper the game were it not there. The voice acting is strong as well. Everyone fits their role and not one that I can remember seems awkward or out of place. Linda Hunt is wonderful as the narrator. Her distinct voice fits perfectly and is a joy to hear every time she speaks. Kratos\\' voice actor (Terrence Carson) is great as well. He brings his own personality to Kratos and it fits like a shoe. Everyone else is strong as said before.\\n\\nGameplay is amazingly fluid. Combos are awesome looking yet simple to pull off. This is great for someone like me who was never too fond of game like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat\\'s complex combo controls. I never liked have to push up, down, left, right, left, left, left, diagonal up left, diagonal down right, B, B, A, up and B to pull off a combo. In God of War it is as simple as O,O,O. That\\'s it but it pulls off an amazing looking combo. Its all fluid and a true joy to use. It makes the game that much better.\\n\\nOne very large fault in this game is its length. It can be beaten, first time through, in less than 8 hours. I am now at the point where I can beat it on God Mode in under 5. On all the difficulty levels (except God Mode) it\\'s way too easy. Yes there are some choke points but overall, its too damn easy. I like a challenge in my games and definetly want them to last longer than this did, expecially if it is this good. There are some graphical glitches every now and then and not all the characters are up to par. Some are downright muddy, but miles ahead of other games\\'. The level design in Hades is the worst part of the game. Its some horrible platforming that goes on and on. The wall of spikes annoyed the hell out of me, it\\'s damn hard.\\n\\nThis game is an instant classic. Its how games should be.

The result is a good game that will keep us hacking and summoning - until the ...3rd coming that is.\\n\\nIn fact, the game developers made sure to often pay tribute to the DIABLO Series: from the background music while at the town-camp (you would recognize those Tristam guitar riffs anywhere!), to the draining health and mana fountains and to the voice announcing & warning, you cannot miss the timeless DIABLO influences. Having said that, I found TORCHLIGHT to be something between a DIABLO and a FATE game.\\n\\nIf you have experienced any of the FATE games you will be reminded of them often, although the heroes here are not children. The village NPCs will keep giving you straightforward quests (usually a go-and-fetch excuse to dwell deeper into the dungeon). Extra dungeons, however, can be accessed by accepting the extra quests of the male NPC in the south and by purchasing dungeon maps of various levels from the local merchants. Also, sometimes a spectral animal appears while in a dungeon: slaying it will open up a bonus dungeon where better equipment often becomes available. There is no traveling to/from town while in a bonus dungeon, so you better keep an empty inventory before entering it.\\nYes, you do get a pet (a dog or a cat - but you can interchange them by purchasing and feeding them a special fish) and, yes, you can transform them by feeding them different types of fishes. Fishing is carried out in pretty much the same fashion: you wait for two concentric circles to merge and their color to change from pale blue to purple but it is less important than it was in FATE (so far I brought in nothing else but fish - no equipment or valuable items).\\n\\nNow, when not playing an AD&D RPG (where I always choose to be a Paladin), I like to play other RPGs as a warlock, a fighting mage. The Alchemist class allows you to both cast powerful spells and exchange blows in the midst of the action (the other available classes is the Destroyer and the Vanquisher). The Destroyer is the up-close-and-personal tank warrior whereas the Vanquisher is the ranger.\\nWhen leveling up as an Alchemist, make sure to get both the (steampunk!) golems and the Ember Strike spell. Together with some good shielding spells, nothing can stand in your way.\\n\\nTry not to go broke. At first I though, \"finally, an RPG that is not stingy with its money\". But that was only at first. Items are less expensive at the shops but (surprise!) they also sell for a pittance. The good news is that money drops like rain from slain foes. The money-hole is the enchanter: attempting to further enchant your equipment will deplete your funds faster than you would imagine! And you also run a considerable risk of having all of its enchantments removed. No post-dated checks are honored. No credit cards accepted. I tried.\\n\\nYou WILL get swarmed so be prepared. Place healing potions, defensive and knockback spells on quick-slots (1-0); equip your pet with self or group healing spells and a powerful summoning spell; and never forget to first stay alive and then keep pounding on your enemies. In the heat of the battle it is best to deactivate (Alt-key) the fallen-items labels (more on this later on) and to always keep an eye on your health and mana levels. Respawning is not free: it will cost you either time, money or experience.\\n\\nThe inventory seems small but, in fact, it is more than adequate. Potions and scrolls are stackable up to 20 and (more importantly) every item takes up only one inventory square (no, you do not have to carry your fishing pole, it is just there).\\nYou can send your pet to town to sell off its inventory and the time it needs to return is much less that what it did in FATE.\\nAnd there are treasure rooms you can only access by finding and pulling levers (sometimes in specific sequence) to open doors or turn bridges.\\n\\nNow, some negative points:\\n(1) the game is only a dungeon crawler, there are no outdoors locations.\\n(2) the graphics of the the spells are very impressive but they can become really confusing as well. Even at maximum settings, unless the fallen-items labels are deactivated you will not be able to actually see much of the battle. That means alternating between fighting and looting - but it also means missing some important interactive objects (levers or ballistas). Also, when electric, fire, ice and poison spells get mixed the result is not something one can discern friend from foe in. It makes no tactical difference (you cannot harm yourself or your company) but it sure would be more enjoyable if you could aim more than...80% of the time.\\n(3) the environments are beautifully designed but your path is often blocked by obstacles that visually you could easily bypass. Sometimes you find your hero running in place, stopped by a ...pebble.\\n\\nFinally, some closing suggestions to the developers for a future patch: (a) add the possibility to order our pet to bring back potions and identification scrolls when sent into town, and (b) make it possible to change class in mid-game (keeping the level and redistributing the skill points).\\n\\nAll in all, TORCHLIGHT is a very enjoyable experience.

I noticed the description of this wheel keeps mentioning \"force feedback\" but I don\\'t believe it said anything about the wheel being mechanically driven.. meaning theres an actual motor behind the wheel that has 100% control. Through that motor, you can control wheel stiffness, centering, etc. There is no spring that launches the wheel back to the original position. I was pretty surprised by this when I plugged it in for the first time and the wheel spun all the way in one direction, then all the way in the other direction, then back to center. I assume is was an auto-calibration. But it did all that without me doing anything other than plugging it in. It\\'s pretty advanced stuff and knocks the socks off of the original \"Farming Wheel\" that this is replacing. As far as the brake petal, I can see how the stiffness could get annoying in a racing game where you need a fast response, but its great for simulator games. The stiffness prevents you from slamming the brakes when you\\'re coming up to a stop.

I played it for the first time this year and while it was fun I can't say I love it. If anything, I enjoyed it mostly because it gave me a nostalgia trip for the original Dark Forces game, which was one of my first computer games back in 1996.\\n\\nJedi Outcast looks and feels dated even though it's been less than a decade. Yes, games age, but even games like KOTOR and Rogue Squadron, which came out around the same time, still look and feel great. By contrast, the graphics in Jedi Outcast just look blocky and flat. The locations are generic. There are even some familiar locales, like Bespin, but you're pretty much stuck in a bunch of rooms that look no different from the Imperial ship later in the game (compare that to the Bespin in the Force Unleashed Wii games, which actually does look like Bespin).\\n\\nHowever, what really frustrated me was the gameplay. The lightsaber combat is uneven and unwieldy. Jumping isn't very precise, which is a big problem because Jedi Outcast thinks it's a platforming game. You often have to make precise jumps onto narrow ledges. This led to no small amount of frustration.\\n\\nI'm not sure why some people rave about the story. The story is pretty rote - the princess (Jan Ors) gets captured, and the hero (Kyle Katarn) has to go find his sword (lightsaber), track down the evil king (Dark Lord Desann), and rescue her. You don't have any choice in the story or outcomes. Even worse, some of the movie characters act out of character. Luke Skywalker seemingly has no problem with Kyle going out looking for revenge against Desann. Lando\\n\\nPerhaps I've just been spoilt by recent games like the Force Unleashed and KOTOR and Rogue Squadron, which have great graphics, controls, and stories. I'm glad I tried Jedi Outcast just to see what ever happened to Kyle. I loved shooting Stormtroopers Dark Forces style.

However, walmart didn't have it. I came back and got back online to see it again. I was extremely disappointed to see how terribly the critics had reviewed it. Still I kept my hopes up and bought it over the weekend. A horribly underrated game. I was not a fan of the original Golden Axe and I can see why some would be disappointed with this debut on next-gen consoles, but it is a traditional hack-and-slash game. Lots of blood, but that makes no difference to me. Several things the critics hit on:\\n\\nPoor storyline: This is true, the storyline is lacking. Yet the developers were trying to make an arcade game next-gen and still stay true to the original. I didn't expect much for storyline.\\n\\nCounter and Evade lags: Counter and evade work like Heavenly Sword where an enemy glows a certain color before attacking. Counter is a little slow, but once you realize this, it is easy to correct with proper timing.\\n\\nBad graphics: It's not the most beautiful game for PS3 (Uncharted or Heavenly Sword wins that for me), but the graphics are as horrible as the critics make it sound. I don't have an HDTV, so I'm just using composite and it looks great to me. Kinda bland with colors of the environment, but that's it.\\n\\nProblems with Beasts: Yeah, they're slow and hard to turn. That was a disappointment as one expects beasts to be faster than the player's running speed. Another complaint is that the beasts die quickly. I haven't had a problem with that. It makes sense in the gameplay that the beasts shouldn't last long. If your beasts dies, just go back and respawn another one. Last thing about beasts, the critics were hard that you can get knocked off of your beast and replaced with an enemy. The solution is simple. Just jump and swing your sword in the air to knock him off. It works for me.\\n\\nNo Multiplayer: For fans of the original Golden Axe, I can see how this is disappointing, however the majority of games I play are single player. So I guess it's a personal preference.\\n\\nIn a world where most next-gen games are first-person shooters, a good hack-and-slash is hard to find. Saying that, I would recommend Devil May Cry 4 and Heavenly Sword over Golden Axe, but if you love hack-and-slash games like me, it's a worth a try.\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 'neutral'},\n",

He\\'s committed heinous acts, but Dante was assured by a bishop that his sins would be pardoned after the fact.  When he arrives home, he discovers his true love, Beatrice, has been murdered and her soul is in peril at the hands of Lucifer. In order to save Beatrice, Dante must traverse the levels of Hell and face each of his personal demons along the way.\\n\\nGAMEPLAY:\\n\\nThis game is set in a 3rd person hack & slash mode, with platforming and puzzle elements. Dante has Death\\'s scythe and Beatrice\\'s cross as his weapons.  Each level has various hidden items including pieces of silver, Holy and Unholy artifacts, and Shades - people Dante comes across which he can choose to absolve or damn for their past misdeeds.\\n\\nA mini-game appears when we choose to absolve someone, and this offers us a Holy points bonus multiplier, depending on how many sins are caught. Damning someone has no mini-game but rewards us with Unholy points.\\n\\nDuring his journey, Dante gains Holy or Unholy experience points which he can use to purchase powerful attack combinations, increase his health/magic levels, and so forth. There are 4 levels of difficulty which can be changed at any time during the game.\\n\\nThe game also has different puzzle types including block puzzles, weighted switch puzzles, mystery door puzzles, and several others.\\n\\nDante\\'s Inferno also offers extra modes including unlocked movies, gameplay cinematics, behind the scenes videos, a challenge mode, and more. The entire canto of Dante\\'s Inferno is included and can be read in a top-down scrolling format.\\n\\nBUT DOES IT FOLLOW THE PLOT OF THE DIVINE COMEDY?\\n\\nWell, yes and no. It\\'s clear the game designers put in a LOT of effort and research into making this game, and there are a lot of similarities to Dante\\'s written work - the levels of Hell, the descriptions of several sinners and their sins found in each area were extremely well done.\\n\\nHowever, the most glaring contradiction is this: In the game, Dante\\'s journey through the underworld is more of a quest to save Beatrice, whereas in the poem Dante was accompanied by Virgil to travel through the levels of Hell, and Beatrice was rarely mentioned at all.\\n\\nTROPHIES:\\n\\nThere are 43 trophies to earn in this title; and 12 more if you purchase the 2 DLC packs.\\n\\nMost of the trophies in this title are fairly easy to obtain, but it can get frustrating because some of the items are hidden a little TOO well. There is no ability to change camera angles, so unless you know where to look, you\\'ll miss a few things your first time through. There is no way to maximize your Holy and Unholy upgrades in one playthrough, so you\\'ll have to play the game at least twice to accomplish this.\\n\\nYou cannot backtrack to previous levels after certain checkpoints are passed, so for the trophy hunters, I would highly recommend a strategy guide.\\n\\nMost of the trophies aren\\'t hard to earn but it does feel like a lot of busy work, similar to finding all the jumps in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Grand-Theft-Auto-IV/dp/B000HKP88C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Grand Theft Auto IV</a>.\\n\\n- CONS:\\n\\nFirst and foremost, this game feels and plays a LOT like God of War. When I first played this game, I felt like I was playing a clone. The combat uses a similar fighting engine, some of the puzzles require moving boxes to certain areas, and boss battles have Quicktime events. Since these elements were all used in the God of War series, it felt like Dante\\'s Inferno copied what worked in those games, but didn\\'t add much of anything new. It\\'s not a bad game, but we\\'ve seen this kind of gameplay used several times before.\\n\\nThe time to completion also counts against this game. It only takes about 5 hours to complete the main storyline. Unless you\\'re a trophy hunter, there is really no desire to play through the game a 2nd time because there is only one possible ending.\\n\\nAs far as the enemies go, they\\'re unique but they eventually become repetitive. As we progress, the same enemies keep showing up, just in greater numbers. After we power up our weapons to Ludicrous level, the enemies doesn\\'t offer much of a challenge.\\n\\nFinally, there is no incentive to play the game through on harder difficulty settings. You can beat this game on the easiest setting and get all the trophies.\\n\\nI found myself wishing the developers had a trophy for completing the game on the hardest difficulty setting like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bioshock/dp/B001B1W3GG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bioshock</a>&nbsp;games, but that wasn\\'t done here. This could have added a lot more replay value and challenge for the trophy-hungry gamers.\\n\\nFINAL VERDICT?\\n\\nWhile this game obviously had a lot of love, exhaustive research and effort put into it, the similar gameplay to the God of War series and the low level of completion difficulty make this game an above-average rental. I\\'ve played through it 3 times, but unless I want to read the entire Canto of Inferno, I doubt I\\'ll play it again.\\n\\nTrophy hunters? This game will bump up your status a bit.\\nCasual players? If you\\'ve already played God of War, you\\'ll feel like you already played this.\\n\\nThere are two more books in The Divine Comedy: Purgatorio and Paradiso. If a new gameplay mechanic is introduced or a trophy is offered for completing the game on the highest difficulty setting, I might give those sequels a try.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 'neutral'},\n",

I couldn\\'t help but drop my jaw when I saw some of the movie sequences when the bright colors filled the screen.  Character expressions were grand and the voices were done quite well.  However, most of the game was not done like this.  You saw only a picture, (still beautiful) of the towns and characters.  You got little to no choices of where to move.  When you entered the a town, you never explored it, talked to random NPCs, instead you looked at a picture of the place and selected areas of the town to enter.\\n  The battles were quite fun, but I wish I could\\'ve been able to cure myself.  The monsters and battle animations were done well also.

              " {'guid': 393, 'text_a': \"Let me get straight to the point.  This game blows and is in my estimation, an early candidate for worst game of the year.  The history of Harry Potter hasn't always been a good one.  They have ranged from fair to acceptable, but have never really reached the heights of imagination from the rich source material that they came from.  However, you could not deny that they were each good, solid efforts with the next iteration improving from the one before it.  Then comes Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1.  Gone are the free roaming explorations of Hogwarts.  This time Harry and friends are on the run.  And with this one bold plot course in the book, goes any semblence of a decent Harry Potter game.  What developer EA Bright Light did so well in the previous game in terms of sandbox gaming is now replaced by a clunky third person shooter.  This gameplay change could have been a welcomed divergence to the previous games if only were the mechanics not so broken.\\n\\nYou start off playing as Harry with one main spell that eventually swells to half a dozen or so while progressing through the game.  I'm okay with the variety, yet I never found myself using anything other than the stupify spell which seemed more effective against enemies.  There is a cover mechanic yet good luck finding a barrier to hide behind that will stick and keep you from getting hit with spell projectiles.  The lock on mechanic is slippery and you'll often find yourself casting spells at empty air when it was focused on an enemy a second ago. Even more odd is that in some parts of the game, the view will shift from a third person perspective to a first person perspective without any rhyme or reason other than the developers trying to shake up the dull gameplay.  There was one instance in the game that literally had me tearing my hair out.  Harry is hidden under his invisibility cloak and must sneak around to accomplish a mission without being discovered.  Once the mission is over, Harry must then sneak back to the original point in which he started in order to trigger a cut scene.  The difficulty level then spikes and all of a sudden you're being discovered without anyone near you.  I must have tried this level a dozen or so times before I finally got past it, yet I have no idea if it was due to my skill or just chance.\\n\\nThe graphics are equally bad.  Though Harry, Hermione and Ron look detailed enough, they inhabit a world of muddy textures and dull environments.  The cut scenes seemed rushed and unfinished and failed to stitch together any semblence of a coherent plot.  Harry is given a mission to find the remaining Horcruxes, yet he then must partake in side missions that involve him sneaking out of a dragon's lair (don't ask how he got there), rescuing muggles and freeing captured wizards.  Weird.\\n\\nI never expected a great Harry Potter game, but I could always expect a competent one that offered me a couple hours of fun as a fan of the series.  Deathly Hallows completely flipped the formula and instead offered a game so ugly and crippled by its gameplay mechanics that it's a shame that the best book in the series could not serve as inspiration for a good game.

Like when GTA San Andreas had you destroying the comic book guy\\'s remote helicopter toys and you had to use a remote helicopter toy to do it. In RDR, there\\'s no real restrictions, if you can kill those legendary animals with a knife, have at it. Want to throw dynamite at them? You can. Or you find them from a distance, get your Carcano Rifle out and try to snipe the elusive beast.\\n\\nMy teenage son said it best, \"Everything in it feels epic\". I think that\\'s what makes this game so great. From the side challenges like trying to skin X amount of a certain wild animal to trying to poke a knife between your fingers in a QTE game to my personal favorite moment of the game. You\\'ve just realized you have a bunch of animal skins to sell but haven\\'t saved. Then you hear it. The sound of a cougar attacking. Those will kill you before you can get your gun pulled, kill your horse too. It\\'s such a fun, intense moment in a usually mid-paced game. The characters throughout the game are either crazy or hilarious or both. Just wait until you have to run behind the bank and hunt the critters. It\\'s a relatively violent, harsh game that doesn\\'t use gore or shock to make it violent. It\\'s almost like an old west simulator. I\\'ve had Red Dead Redemption 2 preordered since last summer. Even worse, I decided to switch from the XB1 to PS4, so now I\\'m going to have to cancel my XB1 preorder and preorder it on PS4. I would rate it as one of the greatest games ever made. The game that comes the closest in old west style is Gun. Nowhere near as challenging as RDR but similar gameplay and setting. By the way, it works great on BC. I\\'ve played it all the way through twice on 360, once on XB1 BC and wouldn\\'t be surprised if I try it on PS Now.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 'positive'},\n",

It\\'s respectful of the classic 1978 game, but this is NOT just a rehash or classic rereleased. This high level of quality for a \"classic remixed\" game is a true rarity, you might find it only a few other places (Pac Man Championship Edition, and New Super Mario Brothers would be 2 good examples).\\n\\nThis is the new definitive version of the game. Forget all the endless rereleases that have come out through the years, this is \"the one\".\\n\\nIt\\'s still 2d, with movements limited to left-right-shoot. But, there are new stategies. There are new enemies. There are enemies that hide behind other enemies, sometimes many of them. There are no bases like in the traditional Old School Space Invaders.\\n\\nThere\\'s an incredible variety in the types of invaders, and they have various attack patterns and formations. The invader attacks are much harder to avoid, especially without the bases to hide behind.\\n\\nSome invaders shoot the traditional bombs, others shoot large lasers, others have shields that block against certain types of your attacks, others wear armor so you have to shoot them several times.\\n\\nThere are bonus rounds which vary as well. You might have to shoot UFO\\'s before a timer runs out, or shoot a certain amount of invaders before the timer runs out. If you can beat the bonus round you earn Fever Time, where you can power up for a short time.\\n\\nShooting a group of the same colored Invaders can yield bonus points and various power ups, like lasers, bullet spreads, and bombs.\\n\\nThere are Boss Fights. Yes, Boss Fights. In Space Invaders.\\n\\nThere is multiplayer. Local (from one cart), or flawless online. There is a Worldwide Rankings board. (The PSP one only has local multiplayer, the DS one is MUCH better).\\n\\nThe music is based electronic, and based on your gameplay. As you shoot, you make the music. And you will love the music you make. It affect the background as well. Trippy, groovy, and perfect for the game.\\n\\nThere is only one downside to Space Invaders Extreme. No paddle controller for America. In Japan, Taito made a weighted knob peripheral for the DS that plugs into the GBA slot at the bottom. It lets you play with a quick twist of the knob, and gives you a big advantage. SE/Tatio did not make this Paddle Controller available in the states but the game will support the paddle if you able to get one from Amazon Japan or PlayAsia. It also works for new new Arkanoid DS game. A definite purchase if you can.\\n\\nFor 20 bucks you won\\'t find a better shooter than this. Buy this game. Now.

              " {'guid': 530, 'text_a': \"I wasn't too excited about MOP after playing the beta.  Finally downloaded it after I uninstalled GW2 after a few weeks and have now leveled up two of my toons to 90 and have one in 469 item level gear.  I have played this game for years and years, and quit several times due to boredom and whatever else.  Here is a rundown of what I think of the game and rating for each category I think important:\\n\\nPanderia!  4 of 5 stars.  As far as wow goes, its the best looking set of zones they have made.  As far as everyone else, its kinda bleh.  The cartoony graphics are fine, they are what they have been for the last eight years.  I was kind of dissapointed with the re-use of so many mob models they have been using for so many years, but they have added quite a bit of new stuff.  The areas are all very nicely done, and large.  Lots to explore, very oriental in feeling, and the quest hubs - while overall nothing very exciting (kill 10 of these and then 10 more of those!) are varied enough to not get overly tedious before you hit 90.  They also added pandas as a race to play which look fine, but not something I get too excited about.\\n\\nPlayer dynamics.  3 of 5 stars.  I play a mage/warrior/hunter as my three main toons, though I have several other 85s.  The talent system was changed dramatically from cata with the replacing of the trees with the new tier system.  Overall they have done a fairly decent job with the talents and there are a few trees that its fun to try different abilities for different fights.  Overall though, its primarily the same talent in three different formats.  DPS talents all do primarily the same dps - they just look different when used.  Also many core talents that used to be specific to a spec on a class are now in the tier.  So many specs seemed to have lost a bit - yet they have gained a little as well since oftentimes you can now use abilities that used to be restricted to another spec.  My fire mage can now use ice shield and my assassination rogue can use shadowstep.  It mixes it up a bit, which is a nice change.  Leveling however, IMO went down the toilet.  I have tried leveling a monk... and I just loose interest.  Since you cannot make any decisions except once every 15 levels, it doesnt really seem like you accomplish much when you gain a level or two.  Often the lower level tiers on the new talent system have talents that don't really impact your character much so it can be very underwhelming.  I find though, with my mage which is best geared main atm, that I stick with the same abilities 95% of the time.  Its also fundamentally the same abilities that I use from cata and before.  While there have been a few tweaks, the character just seems... tired.  I think its just because I have been playing the game for so many years and the overall wow combat system to me is showing some years.  Same set of buttons.. same rotation... over and over and over...  So three stars.\\n\\nMax Level dynamics.  1 of 5 stars.  Wow... why one star???  The new LFR is fine, the bosses look great and are different and so far a few weeks in still fun to do.  The world bosses are ok, a nice change and fun as well.  The thing blizz added that for me is almost a game breaker is how you progress your toon.  In this game, you get gear at level 90 to progress.  You can go do your weekly LFR - maybe an hour or two and your done.  You can do your world boss or two, and another hour.  You can also gain rep with factions and buy valor gear.  This is where for me the game goes down the big toilet bowl of crappy game design.  One huge complaint with cataclysim was there was no incentive to get out in the world.  Everyone sat in the cities and spamed nonsense in trade chat and qued for runs.  Fine, it was bad and they tried to fix it.  Get players out in the world!  WOOO!  Except... to get that valor gear you have to grind dailies to get enough rep with that faction to be able to purchase them.  Revered with this faction for your shoulders.  Honored with these guys for you epic crafting pattern.  Honored with this faction before you can start doing dailies with that other faction to get your legs at revered.  The bummer of it all is that there is no other game mechanic to gain rep other than doing dailies.  If dailies aren't your thing... then your screwed.  You can gain a bit of rep out in the zones by doing the zone quests, but they will not get you enought to get the great gear at the higher levels.  They took out the reputation tabbards and your stuck with... dailies.  Now I enjoyed the heck out of tol borad like alot of other people.  I also liked some of the daily hubs they had with sunwell and a few others.  But I didn't feel like I was falling behind with my guild if I didn't do them for a day or week.  With these... hey, you want to dps on the normal raid runs??  Why don't you have your revered gear yet?  Well... you just lost your spot.  So each night after work, log in, and several hours of the exact same quests you have done for each night for weeks... and tonight I just shut off the game and said to heck with it.  I am so sick of the game already and its only been a few weeks.  I have only partially geared one toon and I cannot take anymore of this grindy daily nonsense.  Its the worst I have seen it in eight years and I don't know now if I will start up again after my annual wears out in DEC.  I cannot imagine at this time even leveling up another of my 85s because at the end of that decently done leveling process is that horrid rep grind nonsense.  If blizz would have given people the OPTION of gaining rep through tabbards and heroic dungeon runs like in cata, this wouldn't be so bad.\\n\\nSo in the end you have a fairly decent leveling process to get to 90 and after a few weeks your stuck doing a few hours of LFR / world bosses hoping you get a purple so you don't have to grind rep with some faction for hours until your ready to throw your comp out the window.  Cataclysim had many issues and overall was kind of dissapointing.  This one was ok at first, and is quickly loosing its appeal.  So two stars for me - they added some decent stuff, but overall MOP is very repetitive, grindy, and underwhelming.\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 'neutral'},\n",

Resident Evil is never going to be the unique little adventurous, ultra gory, atmospheric little Alone in the Dark rip-off I remember it as because when a company considers three of the most broken, overly action packed, laughable additions to the series as \\'essential,\\' then something is very wrong. The atmosphere that the Resident Evil that was introduced in 1996 (thirteen years ago) is NEVER coming back and it\\'s all thanks to its so-called sequels that were almost entirely dedicated to nothing but action.\\n\\nSeriously, look at what they have: Resident Evil Code Veronica X, the port of the all ready overly action packed jerk-fest with a John Woo gunslinging Leonardo Dicaprio dork and a one dimensional antagonist with the addition of a character who magically survived the previous games by a continuity error that was later explained in Umbrella Chronicles in that classic five year old \"because I said so\" excuse solely so said character could be the equivalent of The Terminator meets The Matrix.\\n\\nThen there\\'s Resident Evil Outbreak, the first online survival horror game ever made and quite  possibly the worst (second only to Outbreak file #2) with more of those random cameo characters the developers loved so much they had to include them in the game by snapping the continuity in pieces. Add to the broken single-player game play with some of the most obnoxious enemy AND friendly AI ever made and some of the most atrocious enemy designs made and you\\'ve got pain elemental in one game.\\n\\nThen you\\'ve got EVERYONE\\'s favorite blend of Hollywood action slop and campiness, 4resident evil (hey, that\\'s literally how it\\'s spelled), a game where the only fear you\\'ll get is laughing yourself to death he moment you see the so called \\'terrorists\\' you\\'re fighting.

However, this really started grinding on my nerves after playing for ten hours and seeing the same enemies time after time, much like Gears of War.

This isn\\'t completely the fault of EA. After doing some research on who had played a big part in the creation of the greatest RPG of the 21st century, Baldurs Gate II, I learned that most of the guys that made *that* game have long since left Bioware for greener pastures. Still, Bioware had a duty to re-fill those positions with the brightest minds in the industry, and instead chose people who were experts not at creating absorbing rpg games, but rather those that are experts at creating mindless propaganda pieces, filled with cookie-cutter levels/enemies and ignoring the fans.

The ones they give you are large, yes, but those are still over quite quickly, say 20-45 minutes per level (depending on your skill level). The game can be beaten in a few short hours.

As the series progressed, LUXOR games became more and more self-reliant. With LUXOR 3 the franchise finally comes to age.\\n\\nA series of colored balls (with the number of different colors increasing every few levels) gets pushed and you have to match them in sets of three or more in order to remove them - and prevent them from reaching the end zone. Instead of having the \"shooter\" in the center, it is located at the bottom and it slides left and right. This makes for some quite difficult shots (especially when obstructed by the advancing row of balls) and raises the difficulty of the game.\\nOn the other hand, the power-ups are more powerful, at the end of every round a number of coins and gems drop and \"catching\" them add lives to your paddle. It seems pretty straight-forward yet it can become highly...addictive!\\n\\nCompared to the first installment of the series, LUXOR 3 is graphically more impressive, enriched as to the dropping bonuses (and...penalties) - yet it will seem somewhat easier to seasoned players of the series; nevertheless, it will fulfill the fans craving for more pharaohnic fun!\\n\\nThis is an example of what has come to be known as Casual Gaming: small, resource-light games that are fun for the whole family.\\nIt would be a good idea to download the 60-min trial version from a casual games site, such as REFLEXIVE (you can Google it), and decide for yourself whether this is indeed your cup of tea.

I\\'ll check back in six months, if it lasts that long.  Hopefully by then all the patches and balancing will be done.  If that is the case, then I\\'ll think about picking it up.\\n\\nJUST TO BE FAIR\\n\\nJust be fair I went back and gave it another try. Here is how it went.\\n\\nAnother 22 hour download. Nice\\nReintstalled Dx9\\nReinstalled game\\nGame crashed first attempt, but came up second time no problems.\\nI see that the jump to center, bug/characteristic is still in the control menu, annoying, but tollerable. It\\'s been there since the 1942 version.\\nGetting the control menu to keep my settings took a few attempts. For some reason it was dead set on keeping W set to nothing. I don\\'t use WASD I use ESDF, more keys to the left to use. Similar problems setting up the joystick and mouse, but nothing serious, just had to play a game solo and jump into the menu 10-15 times to keep changing things back, again another characteristic that has been with us since 1942.\\nVideo is similar to BF2, as long as I don\\'t max them out it is very smooth.\\n\\nNo widescreen support, big thumbs down. Closest thing to 1900x1200 is 1600x1200. Some warping, but playable. Sorry kiddies who think wide screen is cheating, I like my 24\" monitor and like having a wider view.\\n\\nThe optimizing shaders annoyance is back from BF2. If you change video setting expect a 5 minute or more wait till it optimizes something. Don\\'t know why this couldn\\'t be done before you try to enter a map in the background, so you are going to be late to the fight the first time after a change.\\n\\nGame play that I tried was Titan. Interesting concept, though nothing original it\\'s been around since the days of UT and RtCW. Moving around and launching aircraft onboard the Titan is buggy quite a bit of the time. The ship moves around subtly causing things to get hung up.\\nWeapons seem to be more accurate, but classes feel kind of generalized due to the reduction in total numbers.\\nSound quality is still pretty muted and generic, all the weapons sound alike, but at least they\\'ve finally figured out what 3d sound is. You know which way it\\'s coming from now.\\n\\nThe powered lift craft, they\\'re not helicopters, they\\'re not airplanes. It feels like they\\'re found the perfect dumbed down sensitivity. BFV they were crazy sensitive, BF2 they felt like you were flying with your hands numb. I personally like things light and sensitive, it took a lot of skill to fly them, but this should help get people up to speed faster and make people less afraid of jumping in with random pilots.\\n\\nLooks like the helicopter instant roll over and play dead bug is still in the game.\\n\\nThe ground vehicles are so so. The weapons have some interesting characteristics, like the curve ball grenades on the walker. Other than that nothing really new.\\n\\nLot\\'s of gun stabilization on vehicle guns finally make accurate passenger support fire possible while on the move.\\n\\nThere is no cover or vegetation which to speak of, but then none of the BF games ever have had much. I like the fatigue bar, but it\\'s a LONG run between things to hide behind, so anyone on foot is still going to be constantly caught out in the open.\\n\\nThe indestructable chain link fences make a return to the game ready to stop your 80 ton tank dead in it\\'s tracks.\\n\\nLight vehicles aren\\'t all that fast and explode almost instantly upon contact with water. Seems even in the future that is still a problem. The walker can wade accross no problems.\\n\\nI saw one of the infamous billboards. It was green and simple said \"The Enemy is out there\" So right they are, but I didn\\'t notice any more than that. No adds. I\\'d rather if they were going to stuff adds in the game to have them in the menu while you are looking for a server to join rather than in the game. The classic \"Brought to you by Brand X\" type placements there would be less strange.\\n\\nThis game feels very much like a mod, it still needs some tweeking to get some things right. The Menu system is still quirky, but seems to be actually stable, which is an absolute first for any BF game. Simple things like not telling you how to set up a joystick are still absent. It\\'s not hard, but it\\'s not obvious either.\\n\\nThere is nothing that interesting to a long time BF vet to make me want to pay money for it. I find the whole thing kind of boring.

And the reason why I originally avoided buying it proved true. Not only is the game too slow-paced too often, but you are constantly repairing your weapons or else they break and you lose them for good. Yeah, I know, breaking weapons sounds more realistic, BUT 1. it takes away from the fun when you have to repair a baseball bat after only 9 or 10 zombie hits, and 2. why would i have to repair a crowbar or solid steel pipe or anything else that obviously can withstand a lot of real-world damage, and 3. why in the HELL do i have to repair a crowbar as often as i have to repair a wooden stick??? Yes, the durability of the weapons in this game is that screwed up.\\n\\nThe Hit Detection is horrible in this game (Zombies can magically hit you while having the same reach as you and yet you can\\'t hit them unless you move closer), and the Aiming of the crosshairs in this game is spazmatic. Literally. You move the crosshairs to aim your next attack and it wobbles around the screen like someone having a seizure is controlling the analog stick.\\n\\nWhat\\'s REALLY stupid is that in this game you have to go around collecting money to not just buy things like weapons (which is a given) but you have to pay to repair and upgrade and modify your weapons. Sounds like something inconsequential to gripe about, right? Well you repair/upgrape/modify your weapons by collecting things around the island and then you find a workbench and your character chooses from the free things you have gathered and for some reason then have to pay to use them. Umm, if i collect a roll of duct tape and a knife and want to \\'modify\\' my baseball bat at a workbench by taping the knife to the end of my bat, WHY do i have to PAY to tape that knife to my bat when I\\'M the one doing it and it\\'s MY stuff that I collected??? It makes NO sense, but obviously then needed to institute some sort of system. It\\'s just a crappy, unnecessary system.\\n\\nThe game looks good, but even the nice graphics cannot stop the boredom from creeping in. There\\'s a LOT of walking (or driving, but i\\'ll get to that in a minute) around, then you see a zombie or 2 and kill it, then a lot more walking around. Basically nearly EVERY mission is a \"Fetch\" quest where someone needs this item so you go from point A to point B, get the item, then return back to point A where you learn you need to get another item, so you then leave point A and go to point C, get the next item only to return to point A again where now at point D theres another item you need to fetch. Basically that\\'s the missions of this game. And THAT would be fun IF there were a lot more roaming zombies and a lot better fighting/hit detection system in place.\\n\\nSomething i REALLY hate is because the weapon system is crap you find yourself using the melee attack button often, the only problem is there are only 2 preset controls and neither have the melee attack assigned to a more \"convenient\" button. One is the default with it assigned to the L Bumper, and the other changes it, but ALSO changes the controls into some weight \"analog\" fighting control scheme I\\'ve never seen in any game before that\\'s just awkward and confusing.\\n\\nAnd now the driving. yes, you can drive, and if you DO play this game remember to get the truck fixed ASAP as if you wait you will be doing a LOT of boring walking around. BUT driving is almost as annoying as walking because the viewpoint from inside the truck is so awkward you are constantly driving into things and getting stuck because it looks like you\\'ll clear by it but you don\\'t.\\n\\nThe island IS big, which is cool, and the zombies seem to randomly respawn so it\\'s not like you clear an area and then its forever rid of zombies, BUT with the little amount of zombies sprinkled around the island AGAIN you will find yourself getting bored every few minutes before a short action burts, then back to the boring traveling again.\\n\\nI LOVE Zombie games, and it\\'s hard for me not to like Dead Island as i really tried, but there\\'s just too much wrong with it -even with the free dlc the GOTY comes with- to recommend it for anything more than a weekend rental. TAKE MY ADVICE: if you\\'re looking for a fun zombie game, BUY LEFT 4 DEAD GOTY. It\\'s literally one of the best games I\\'ve ever played, one of the funnest, and it beats Dead Island HANDS DOWN in every category.\\n\\nAlso, this GOTY version has a new character and stuff but the game only comes with the original game booklet which doesn\\'t say anything at all about him or his skills or specialties or anything. You\\'d think they\\'d at least update and put in a newer instruction booklet.\\n\\nI give this game 2 stars. Fighting the zombies is just too annoying because of the shoddy hit detection and the annoying spazzy crosshairs, having to repair your weapons CONSTANTLY (at least until further in the game when you can PURCHASE upgrades) is just plain annoying, and there\\'s just too much wandering around where nothing much of anything happens while you\\'re on one of the too-many \"Go Fetch This-Or-That Item\" quests. Maybe I\\'ve given it an unfair lower rating because I can\\'t help but compare it to Left 4 Dead, but that only confirms my advice to DEFINITELY buy LEFT 4 DEAD over this game any day of the week, and twice on Sunday.\\n\\nAnd REMEMBER: I recommend the ORIGINAL Left 4 Dead Game of the Year edition, NOT Left 4 Dead 2. Although the second one is fun, the original is MUCH better. The second one added in a melee system so you can use bats and axes and whatnot (and funny enough their melee system is WORLDS BETTER than that of Dead Island, too) but they also added in a wider variety of special-type zombies, and the types they added are just annoying to the point that you wish they would have kept everything the same as the original but just made the second one a bunch of more levels.\\n\\nAnyways, there you go and i hope this helps. Just don\\'t blame me if you don\\'t heed my advice =-)', 'text_b': None, 'label': 'neutral'},\n",

An exhilarating, horrifying jaunt through a gorgeous Gothic nightmare, Bloodborne is a fittingly brutal follow-up to From Software\\'s household name action-RPG series. From the terrific and terrifying art design to the swift, palpable combat, Bloodborne eschews the broad sweeps of its fantasy brethren in favor of viscera-soaked terror, and it\\'s all the better for it.\\n\\nBloodborne\\'s story is every bit as opaque as its Souls predecessors\\': a tellingly labeled \"hunter\", you\\'re loosed upon the city of Yharnam to fell all manner of horrors that lie within. These range from deranged infected townsfolk to massive werebeasts, and each foe you face is entirely capable of slicing you limb from limb unless you\\'re careful...\\n\\n... Or quick! Unlike the Soul\\'s series, Bloodborne makes it clear from the get-go that speed and aggression are your two best friends on the night of the hunt. Gone are shields and tank-like heavy armor-- instead, you\\'re supplied with a firearm and a \"trick weapon\". While firearms are excellent tools for stunting enemy attacks and stemming their charge, trick weapons offer two switchable forms, each with its own unique set of moves. Learning to mix-and-match your trick weapon forms is a must, as some enemies won\\'t play nice up close (or afar, for that matter). Aggressive play is also highly encouraged with a newly implemented regeneration system. If you\\'re wounded , you\\'re given a chance to regain lost health but getting up close and personal with your attacker. By literally bathing in their blood, you regain health... I can\\'t make this stuff up.\\n\\nUnraveling the secrets of the world is one of the best parts of Bloodborne, and there\\'s a large spool to pull from. The game is rife with hidden passages, cryptic story bits, great NPC dialogue give-aways, and some excellent nods to Lovecraftian horror. Bosses, while terrifying surprises in their own right, are incredibly rewarding to best: you\\'ll be whooping with joy once you topple some of these monstrosities, and with good reason, too. Bloodborne is a game crafted so deftly, its hard not to walk away a little dazed.

For some background, When I was 12-13 years old I played Halo: CE and here and there played Halo 2 with friends that owned the game. I spent maybe 15-20 hours on the original Halo games included in the MCC. Also, I did play the s*** out of Halo: Reach and it remains one of my favorite games to date. I had high expectations for the MCC because of Reach and have been severely disappointed.\\n\\nAs of 12/1/14:\\n\\n* Multiplayer is screwed up. I've been able to get into 4 matches. One was 5v2, one 2v0, one 1v0. The last was actually 8v8 and it was fun, but I don't think I'd be playing it much. The red vs blue gives a very old vibe that is fairly boring.\\n\\n* Graphics look good compared to the original games, but I expected a lot more. Compared to newer great looking games like Destiny, Assassins Creed (Black Flag... haven't tried Unity), and even The Last of Us, Halo graphics are kinda pathetic.\\n\\n* Texturing... ugh. I've never thought I cared much about texturing until I played this game. Halo MCC looks sparse and bland, especially CE and 2.\\n\\n* This might be a little controversial to some of you, but I do not care for the campaigns. Halo: Reach's story was absolutely amazing and I was totally engrossed in the probably 12 times I played through it. I feel almost bored going through CE, 2, 3, and 4 missions. Out of them all, I'm enjoying 2 and 3 the most.\\n\\n* Playing with friends can be a frustrating experience when connecting with one another. Some kinks need to be worked out where if the party leader leaves a mission (or a multiplayer lobby), the rest of the group should too. There are lots of little problems like that. Also, it takes a long time for the friends list to even load and sometimes friends that I'm chatting with in a party (and are in game) do not appear on the list.\\n\\n* I am not happy with the control setups available to me. I've been playing a good bit of Destiny and BF4, and going to Halo controls has been an annoying experience. I'd very much like to be able to assign my own controls how I like them if popular layouts aren't offered.\\n\\n* Actual gunplay is frustrating. I like having a very precise reticle so I know exactly what I'm shooting at (mostly for headshots) and the reticles in Halo MCC aren't fulfilling. Other games, I usually kill with headshots 70% of the time in multiplayer and 80-90% in single player/coop. In Halo, single player/coop is probably around 20%.\\n\\nI'm usually a skeptic so spending $60 on all this amazing content that was being advertised was pretty out-of-character and it should have been a red flag. I'll not make that mistake again. I will say that if you are a big fan of Halo, you'll probably eat this game up and love it. But for those of you who don't have an attachment to previous Halo games and are looking for current-gen quality, don't get your hopes up.

After a fight you can trade one fighter to get the best mix of weapon and styles for the fight ahead.  The game really picks up when you get some of the characters who fight with the various swords...some insane fun can be had with the usual combos and air juggles you can pull off with these guys!\\nHow does it play?  Imagine Killer Instinct-style gameplay where moves and combos can be strung together with simple button presses.  Persevere and learn the combo system and you have yourself a competent fighting game.  If you just mash the buttons and jump around hoping for random victories, then you\\'ll get less out of this game.\\nThe bottomline:  If you enjoy 2D fighting games and you like learning the combo and timing system, then this is definitely a reasonably priced game for you.  If you prefer your fighters in 3D, hate fighters or are one of those people who just mash buttons and \"hope for the best\", then forget it.

In the past month or so, I only lost my savegames on the Live server twice and have only had it crash itself once.  That said, here is the original review.

I had updates crash the game, my license key invalidate itself, and after unanswered support e-mails, it took me multiple calls and over 3 hours on the phone to get someone to fix the problem.  They had to do this by removing my license key, issuing me a new one, and telling me I\\'d lose all my \"achievements\" and account info.  That wasn\\'t a great loss, since the program would regularly log me into Live, then say, \"You are not logged into Live.  You will not be able to have any Achievements.  Sorry about that.\"  A lot of the messages I get in Halo 2 say, \"Sorry about that.\"  Sorry, indeed.\\n\\nBy the time I actually got the game to work (with shuddering framerate and random dropouts in sound), I was just angry.  Angry at all the \"Sorry\" messages, angry at the hassle I have to click through just to load a saved game, and angry at the constant savegame level resets.

              " {'guid': 779, 'text_a': 'I\\'ve started my third year playing this game after a six month break and am now enjoying it more than ever. This is a game that requires a lot of time for everything. Time to go from place to place, time to level up your jobs (I don\\'t say character because you play any job you want to and switch from job to job without making a new character). It also takes a lot of time to make money and there are many ways to make money in the game it just requires ALOT of patience.\\n\\nGetting started in this game can be very difficult and frustrating at times but if you talk to people most of them will help you out and guide you to where you need to get to. The game starts you out with you choosing the race you want to play as throught the game. The races you get to choose from are Hume\\'s (male or female), Elvaan\\'s (male or female), Mithra\\'s (female only), Galka\\'s (male only) and the Tarutaru\\'s (male and female). Although there aren\\'t a lot of different races there are many different combinations you can make for each character so running into a similiar character isn\\'t so frequent. This is also where you will pick your main job and there are six jobs to choose from when you first start. After that you choose which country your character lives/comes from and there are three to choose from. The three countries are Bastok, Windurst and Sandoria. Bastok is made up of the Hume\\'s and Galka\\'s, Windy has the Mithra\\'s and Tarutaru\\'s and Sandy is home of the elvaans but you can choose whichever one you want.\\n\\nRaces: Depending on what job you want to do might help you choose the race you want to play as each race is proficient in certain jobs. The Galka\\'s are made for jobs such as Paladin and Warrior classes (tanks jobs in pt\\'s), Elvaan\\'s are geared towards Monk and Dark Knight (Damage Dealer\\'s in pts or DD\\'s if you will), Mithra\\'s are for the Thief and Ranger jobs (support or pullers for ur party), Hume\\'s are the basic all around character and are proficient in any job but don\\'t specialize in a paraticular one and Tarutaru\\'s are the magic wielding jobs such as the White Mage and Black Mage jobs (healer\\'s and debuffs in the party). However, you can pick whatever race you want and whatever job you want just remember that Galka\\'s are not gonna be as good as Tarutaru\\'s in magic and Tarutaru\\'s aren\\'t gonna be as good as Galka\\'s for tanking.\\n\\nJobs: The player is given six jobs to choose from called your basic jobs. They are warrior, thief, monk, white mage, black mage and red mage. I\\'m not gonna go into details because that could take to long. There are 14 other jobs available once the player reaches 30. The player has to do quests to unlock the other jobs and can find out how to by asking someone or just looking it up online. The other jobs are ranger, dark knight, paladin, blue mage, samurai, ninja, corsair, bard, beastmaster, puppetmaster, summoner, scholar, dancer and dragoon. Also for jobs you get to have a subjob which means you have a main job and a job to support it. For instance, say the player is a paladin, the player then gets to choose a job to support that. The player will want to choose a subjob that will support the main job, so that player will most likely choose warrior for the defense bonuses and job abilities that warrior has. Also the subjob is half the level of the main job so if the paladin is lvl 30 the warrior will be lvl 15 with all the abilites the warrior gets at 15. Also by adding warrior as a subjob extra hit points are added onto you\\'re character because of the job warrior. Each subjob presents its own pros and cons, so the player needs to know what subjob best supports the main job.\\n\\nThe storyline progresses at the players leisure and since there are tons of quests and missions that the player will be doing its easy to forget what you\\'ve done unless you\\'re progressing really fast which is highly unlikely. Doing missions earns your rank in your home country and quests earn you fame in different countries which definately benefit the player. One example is the \"Lure of the Wildcat\" quest in each town (Sandy, Basty, Windy and Jeuno) when completed gives the player to get teleported to Aht Urghan Whitegate from whatever town they teleported from which will save a lot of time and only costs 300 gil per teleport.\\n\\nThe game is definitely geared for the hardcore people who can spend a lot of time in the game. This is definitely a game where you reap what you sew. If the player just wants to casually play the game and just party and level and talk to friends they can. The thing is that by playing casually the player will most likely not get the really best gear in the game and around level 50 will either start another job or just slowly stop playing the game. The game requires a lot of time, gil and patience for the good armor and weapons in the game if the player is willing to sacrifice it.\\n\\nThis particular edition of final fantasy xi combines the original release plus all the expansions up to the latest wings of the goddess. Each expansion has added new jobs, areas to explore and more missions and quests. I\\'m not sure what all was added with the first three expansions to the game (rise of zilart, chains of promethia, treasures of aht urghan) as I did not start playing this game till well after the release of TOAU. I do know, however, the Wings of the Goddess expansion released two new jobs: Dancer and Scholar. It also let the player travel to the past (20 years to be exact) through things called Cavernous Maws. WOTG expansion is aimed at the higher level players and I suggest not traveling to the past unless you are 60+ or have someone that can guide you.\\n\\nI found this final fantasy XI a really good buy when it first came out and now that its twenty dollars its well worth the buy. I\\'ve heard people complain about the monthly charge of the game on top of the xbl charge. *For your information:you can play this game on the xbl silver account.* Thing is that most people don\\'t just play this game, they play others as well on xbl and the monthly fee is from the maker\\'s of the game. Alot of mmorpg\\'s have a monthly charge and this one is no different. The updates and installing can take a really long time, maybe to long but you really shouldn\\'t let that deter you from at least trying this game out.\\n\\nThere is so much more to this game and is hard to put in a review, I really don\\'t think its possible to review even half of what this game has to offer someone who really is interested in playing. The only areas that I can think of where this game suffers is the exceptionally hard to make money or gil for weapons and gear and the long installing process and the sometimes very long updates.\\n\\nAll I can really tell you is try the game out and decide for yourself whether or not its a game you want to put a lot of time into. Just remember if you get stuck there are people you can ask to help you out and most of them will be more than happy to. Don\\'t be quick to judge the game from just the beginning, it takes awhile to really get into the heart of the game itself so get out there try it and keep at it.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 'neutral'},\n",

If you purchase a Wii off the shelf, it will cost you 52% more for GHWT with an extra guitar (for the full 4 instrument experience) than RB2 with an extra guitar.  If the percentage is removed from this, then just go ahead and delete the whole review.  Talk about censorship!\\n\\nI know there is a heated argument about GH vs RB, but the way that Activision has chosen to RIP OFF Wii users makes the Wii decision SIMPLE AND FINAL.\\nIf you buy a Wii, you will probably want a second Wii remote, but even if you don't buy one, you can get Rockband 1 or 2 and play the WHOLE game.  It only requires ONE Wii remote to play with a microphone, guitar and drums and if you get another guitar, you can add a bass guitar.\\nIf you buy GH World Tour for the Wii you will need to purchase two additional Wii remotes in order to play with 3 instruments and you will need to buy a 4th Wii Remote to play with two guitars.\\nThe fact that they decided to set the game up this way is not quite so bad.  The problem is that the list price is the SAME as PS3 and Xbox360 versions.\\nBoth RB and GH require ONE remote for the microphone, but GH requires another remote for each additional instrument.  I wonder how hard Activision was laughing when they figured out how much money they would save on the wireless controller components that are built in on the RB1 and RB2 guitar and ALSO on the RB2 drums.\\nDO NOT try to blame this on the Wii.  Rockband 1&2 has provided these controller components for their Wii version built into the guitars and drums (and yes, even the RB1 drums have a controller built in, it is just not wireless).\\nBottom line on this (I will use list prices here):\\nWii game comes with one controller. After that, in order to play RB1 or RB2 with all 4 instruments, it will cost you the following:\\nRB1 special edition PLUS additional guitar - $[...] (I do not recommend buying any of the RB1 stuff at this point though because the RB2 stuff is almost the same price)\\nRB2 special edition PLUS additional guitar - $[...]\\n\\nTo play GHWT with all 4 instruments on a standard Wii, you will need to spend $[...] PLUS $[...] for 3 additional Wii remotes totaling $[...].\\n\\n$[...] to do the same thing that you can do with RB2 for $[...], yet they charge the same for the game and extra guitar controller as they do for the ones they make for Xbox360 and PS3.\\n\\nI ordered GHWT for the Wii and have not received it yet, and I may actually keep it, even though I will need to spend AT LEAST $[...] for one additional remote (I have 2 already) just to play the whole game, but if I am not happy with it for any reason, I am going to return it to ACTIVISION on the grounds of FALSE advertising.  It says the exact same thing on the outside of the Wii box as it does on the Xbox360 and PS3 boxes.\\nOne Wireless Guitar controller\\nOne Wireless Drum controller\\n\\nTHESE ARE NOT WIRELESS CONTROLLERS.

I review from this perspective.\\n\\nOn the plus side, Puzzler World is polished and addictive.  The puzzles are fast and light, and you get a nice reward flourish when you solve one, so you want to just keep going and solve more and more of them.  The game was definitely fun enough to keep playing and was a great way to kill small blocks of time.  Also, there were some puzzle types that I found particularly enjoyable -- my favorites were Link-A-Pix and Codeword.  Overall, I found Puzzler World fun enough that I wanted to solve every puzzle.\\n\\nHowever, on the minus side, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this game, for many reasons.  About half of the puzzles were designed for children and could be solved in less than one minute.  In fact, an expert puzzle solver could solve many puzzles in less than 15 seconds.  Example #1:  there are many \"puzzles\" that involve filling in a diagram where some spaces have dots in them.  This is mildly fun with pencil and paper, but with the DS, you just poke the dots with your stylus and the spaces fill in automatically, so there\\'s zero challenge and zero fun from drawing.  There are also way too many word searches, hangmans, simple jigsaws, simple math problems, and other trivial, boring puzzles.  (Though I have to admit, I do enjoy the simple anagrams.)  But besides the many trivial puzzles, there were also too many sudokus.  I don\\'t like sudokus, I find them repetitive and a \"grind\".  Fortunately, you don\\'t have to play any puzzle type you don\\'t like -- I chose to solve them anyway so I could beat the entire game.  Sudokus were a fraction of the puzzles in the game, but I\\'d guess that I spent most of my time playing sudoku, just so I could beat all the puzzles.  (In fairness, there is a way to get past the grind parts of any puzzle, by using \"hint coins\" that you gain from solving other puzzles.  I just chose not to use any hint coins.)  Lastly, I wasn\\'t impressed with the crosswords.  I dislike pseudo crosswords where clues are only available in one dimension for some squares, as it means you are more likely to get blocked on a single word you don\\'t know.  Again, I could have used the hint coints, but chose not to.  In the end, there were only two puzzle types representing about 10% of the puzzles that I found very fun and compelling.  In Codeword, you have to decode a solved crossword where all the letters are replaced by numbers.  In Link-A-Pix, you have to draw a color picture based on logic.\\n\\nBottom line:  expert puzzle solvers will not find these puzzles challenging, but, you are not required to play any puzzle type you don\\'t like, and it\\'s still a good way to kill small blocks of free time.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 'neutral'},\n",

In my opinion, and in many opinions from what you can read online, OoT is THE quintessential Zelda game. And I believe that people have been seeking the feeling we got from OoT ever since. But Nintendo has failed to deliver that over and over, and while TP and SS were GREAT games, they just were not the same . . . leading fans to be desperate enough to give this game a five star rating. Especially when you consider how long we\\'ve been waiting for the game after so many delays. Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s a fun game, and I\\'m glad I picked it up. It\\'s just not a 5 star Zelda game. I\\'ll tell you why below, but beware, there may be minor ***SPOILERS***\\n\\nNintendo clearly spent huge time and effort creating the ultimate Zelda sandbox. The world is vast, the interactivity is better than ever before, there are infinitely more items to collect, people to meet, weapons and outfits to acquire . . . it\\'s great! But it\\'s an incredibly superficial game that doesn\\'t take much thought to progress through.\\n\\nPros:\\n- A vast Zelda world.\\n- An items and inventory menu on par with typical massive adventure games. MUCH MUCH MUCH better than any Zelda game ever. Pages and pages.\\n- Great graphics and immersive audio/soundtrack.\\n\\nCons:\\n- The voice acting (which at first I was excited about) was HORRID. So bad I wished they just continued with their tradition of leaving the voices to the imagination of the player.\\n- The character development is corny to say the least, and often times bordering on infantile. The characters just do NOT convey the desperation you should be feeling with Calamity Ganon very clearly alive and ready to consume everything. Even the main characters which should be hardened warriors are just . . . I don\\'t even know what to call them.\\n- The translation of the game from its original language is very awkward and leaves you wondering what you just read sometimes. You get the message but it\\'s just very poorly done.\\n\\n- THIS IS THE BIG ONE: There is a huge lack of substance when it comes to gameplay. The only reason to put hours into this game is because it\\'s so huge, and has nothing to do with an actual challenge. Traditional dungeons have been replaced with \"shrines,\" which take about 2-3 minutes max to beat, and sometimes they take no time to beat if the shrine was at all challenging to get to. You just walk in and collect what you collect. There is a lack of specialty items that are required to advance (for example, a hook shot).  I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t care how many miles Link has to walk, and how many creatures he can see if at the end of the day there aren\\'t deep, dark, challenging puzzles and dungeons to play through. That\\'s the meat of a Zelda game!\\n\\nOverall, I am happy with the purchase, and would purchase it again. I have to say though, this is a FAR cry from \"the next Ocarina of Time\" or the best Zelda game there is. It is clear to me that Nintendo spent more time building the land and the items you collect than they did in creating challenging puzzles and dungeons. If you are a diehard Zelda fan, there are going to be a few big gaping holes that leave you wanting something else.\\n\\nTL;DR, Nintendo created something fun to look at, but it\\'s painfully obvious, and often so, that they replaced quality Zelda with quantity Zelda.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 'neutral'},\n",

              " {'guid': 829, 'text_a': 'First of all, I picked this game up, midnight launch at Gamestop, because I did not want to wait for UPS to get to me at five in the afternoon. I live in the city, but I guess its there route? I love amazon, but I didn\\'t want to lose all that time I could be playing on waiting. My excitement for Dark Souls 2 was really high. (woe to me though)\\n\\n(Please actually bother to read my full review before actually down voting. Seriously, grow up. )\\n\\nMy expectations were REALLY high for Dark Souls 2. But I guess FromSoftware just couldn\\'t bring themselves to make a better game... They are stuck so deeply in their ways. And that\\'s both good and bad. If I were you, I would seriously be careful about reading all the positive reviews of the game. This game has a lot of good ideas/elements in it, in theory, but in execution, it fails right through the floor.\\n\\nAnyways, Dark Souls 2, is just like Dark Souls 1 in a lot of gameplay mechanics. Boss fights have there gimmicks, fighting normal enemies, is actually worse than Dark Souls, in the sense that, frame\\'s from enemy attacks are completely cut out. Trying to back stab enemies, is a LOT harder but really needed to do any damage, but almost impossible to do. Trying to parry enemies, is A LOT HARDER, almost impossible. Upgrades to weapons, while to some degree more straight forward, they are still lacking. Upgrading a weapon from 1 to 10.. is a tedious task. Because unlike Dark Souls 1, your merchant of choice, only has so many items on hand.. and then after you buy so many, come back, yadda yadda, rinse wash and repeat, you\\'ll get more, maybe. I believe its on which area of the game you make it to.. combined with how much you buy. Although I don\\'t have the guide, so I am not sure about this. But its tedious to say the least. Horribly annoying (Insert curse words here) at best.\\n\\nSo instead of a enemy character in game, going through a full range of emotions, giving you time to react. Such as A,B,C, and D, where as D would be the completed end action of the enemy. They just go A to D. So you see an enemy getting ready to attack, you gotta time it perfect, and not block, but roll out of the way I am guessing? Now when this is on a little small ledge and you can\\'t do that, well your pooper is going to get banged by the enemy. So its frustrating. In New game + with red phantoms, who are basically walking tanks and apparently don\\'t have to meet the same stat requirements as your character.. it turns into a nightmare, even with +10 weapons.\\n\\nEnemy tracking is next to godhood in this game. Enemies who are in close range, rarely miss you. On the other hand, your player tracking...works at best, and at its worst, will either pull you to your death if an enemy gets knocked off a cliff edge, or even when the automatic targeting is turned off in game. For some reason it still is on? Like you will be fighting one enemy and then the targeting will jump to another enemy completely throwing you off balance right at the most horrible time to do so.. Leaving you cursing in frustration.\\nFrom my perspective, in how fast the enemies attack you, and the range of motions they can go through verses.. the range of motions your character goes through, stamina recover, etc... The game is fundamentally broken. Not so much broken in the sense, that you can slowly slowly make your way through it, as long as you don\\'t die and lose your souls.. and then die and lose your souls permanently trying to make your way back to said soul drop. Some areas of the game you\\'ll get bottle necked, and that\\'s the way the game is designed. Its set up with a bunch of innocuous looking traps by the developers. Basically to see how far you can make it.. and how hard they can ram there estus flask up your pooper, because cost of the game wasn\\'t enough.\\n\\nThey didn\\'t fix one of the biggest problems they had with the first game. And that is, Souls still count as both experience and currency. Which makes the game so flipping broken/hard its not even funny. So you\\'ll be fighting resource management all the way through the dang game. And like I said, if you die trying to get back to 20,000+ souls, 50,000+ souls... That totally messes you up. Especially if you have screwed up one too many times and have no human effigy\\'s. They do have a few rings you can find in game, literally three I believe, that will take up one of your very valuable much needed ring slots because the stats upgrades are messed up. IE useless, that allows you to nullify death. But the ring breaks of course on death and then you\\'ll have to spend 3,000 Plus souls to 6,000 I believe souls to fix said ring.\\n\\nThey tried to add in PvP to Dark Souls 2 and make it work. This was one of the hugest most tragic mistakes by FromSoftware in my perspective, because its trying to combine two completely different elements of gameplay and make it work...I can\\'t comment on PC games. But on console games, as far as I know, most game developers have always had Story, and PvP separate, for good reason. It\\'s like trying to combine oil and water, it can be done, but it doesn\\'t work. Because when your fighting mini bosses, and that\\'s what a lot of the enemies in the game are, you don\\'t need some douchebag to show up and invade you during this time. And that\\'s exactly what will happen in Dark Souls 2. Because from a strategic stand point, when is the best time to invade someone? when you have the advantage. The Co-op is fine. It works right now because you can find people to summon.. pretty much all the time, and you can get summoned decently. But so help you if you are trying to make your way back through the game and get your souls, and some BS magic user is the one who\\'s invaded you. Which will most likely be the case. Because he/she will OWN YOU. Magic.. verses a melee based character.. unless your a god at Dark Souls2. Your pooper is going to be flooded with an object you don\\'t want.\\n\\nSpeaking of Invasions. There is now a backwards invasion system, sort of. You get summoned forcefully to the world of another user when you enter a particular area of the game. The \\'Rat Covenant\\' and your goal as far as I can tell, you know besides being pulled into PvP you don\\'t want to participate in, is to either defeat the user... or make it to the end of the area.\\n\\nSo then if the gameplay mechanics, and underlying structure of the game is basically broken? What\\'s good about Dark Souls 2?\\n\\nWell, Dark Souls 2, has a TON of great armor, at least aesthetically that you can get. Has a lot of very very cool weapons you can get as well. Now even when you upgrade them to max. Their still not going to be as potent for you, as they are for any enemy character using the same weapon. It has a pretty cool world, nice fantasy setting. The enemy designs are nice looking. Some are even sexy looking.\\n\\nThey actually fixed the crossbow gun, you can now manually aim it. Which is wonderful. The range on Archery is better, and the aiming movement on it is a lot better.. you can look a little higher when firing off an arrow, and you can aim a little lower then in Dark Souls. Archery is improved over dark souls, not by the standard it should. Archery is still playing third fiddle to melee, and to magic its far off..\\n\\nThey improved the moveset of a lot of weapons.\\n\\nBut upgrades, while straight forward, you just don\\'t get the much needed umph from the weapons you need to face the enemies... verses the trouble you go through to collect the materials to upgrade them. The scaling, even on upgraded weapons, again, its not all that great.\\n\\nAnd I really believe like I mentioned above, that a lot of this is FromSoftware trying to make PvP and PvE go together. Quite frankly the only thing they\\'ve ever gotten right is the fact that you can be invaded.. but as far as balance goes.. I don\\'t think its something that will ever work out. Just because of all the elements involved.\\n\\nSo to sum it all up in a nice little neat package. The world seems better, seems bigger, but its really just as small as the first game. Levels are just a bit more open, but it isn\\'t an open world at all. Travel is improved. Weapon moveset\\'s have improved. Cool enemies, some cool characters you get to talk to. A lot of cool armor sets, if you can find them or get the drops. Drop rate\\'s have not improved by much. Fundamental gameplay and mechanics of the game are broken because they are trying to combine PvP(Player verses player) and PvE (Player verses enemies in game). You\\'d think they would have learned more from Dark Souls and other RPG\\'s. You\\'d think armor would actually do its job but it really doesn\\'t. The difficulty curve of the game goes at a steady climb and then just spikes through the roof toward the end of the game (Maybe I should say \"ends\"). So you will probably start running into a lot of brick walls in the game. The game is designed with a lot of traps. So its not like they say \"learning from your mistakes\" its \"Learning to spot FromSoftware\\'s traps\" would be much more appropriate. They think this is making the game hard.. but anyone can put a person in a box an then beat the fire out of them, and call it \"Were making this challenging\" but that\\'s not really making the game harder, so much as making the game abusive to the player.\\n\\nA lot of awesome elements in the game. And it really could be such a fun experience and really bring friends together. But being as co-op is sporadic at best. (Kinda depends if everyone is in the same area and hoping someone is human and actually has some human effigy\\'s to use).. Overall the game just turns into a hodge podge of mixed emotions. My own personal experience with the game was as follows:\\n\\n This is cool, maybe I can team up with some friends on my xbox live list, NOPE!.. new areas to explore. Fall to my death. Get pushed to my death. Fall through a hole in the ground get ganged up on by petrification lizards.. Get man handled by the enemies no matter the armor I am wearing. Get man handled by bosses. Walk into a boss fight that literally has a room full of poison. Fall to my death some more. Get pegged by archers from a mile away. Start to get effing bitter about this. Get confused about what I have to do. Friend reminds me of obscure forest of fog.. Make a little headway. Get owned by a giant mammoth enemies.. quite literally. It helped they had archers backing them up. Grow increasingly bitter as I fight my way through the game. Get lost some more. AND FINALLY beat the game. Start new game plus... and just invasions out the wazoo. Every dang time I\\'m turning my head, invaded if I am online. Garbage... Bitter bitter. Break a controller. Speaking of which, their seems to be MORE LAG, in between input and action from your character than Dark Souls.\\n\\nLong story short, if your competitive, and have fighting spirit.. don\\'t play this game. Seriously avoid it. Because you\\'ll want to win. But the game will just keep crushing you no matter what you do. So you will probably more likely get bitter about it. So highly suggest taking breaks from the game on a regular basis before things get bad. That was my strategy anyways with the game. Still end up killing off a controller.\\n\\nThe only way to win this game, is to not play.\\n\\nOverall the game is okay. Nothing great or innovative about it. Aesthetically on console the game is alright. And I know some people say that \"looks don\\'t matter\" \"resolution doesn\\'t matter\" but in the Dark Souls universe where \"tells\" by the enemy is what makes the difference between life and death a lot of the time, that and gameplay matter a HUGE AMOUNT. And the game is lacking a little on that front. It is harder than Dark Souls in its own right.\\n\\nAgain I really want to emphasize that my hopes were high, but 3/4 of the way through the game, that just turned to bitterness as I started getting smeared against the walls upgraded armor and all, as things ground to a fault. Because the further you make it into the game, at least with a melee based character, no magic, no miracles.. you start to realize things are broken bad.\\n\\nBuy at your own risk.\\n\\nThis is just my personal take on the game. Good luck. Thanks for reading.\\n\\nUpdate #1 April 6-2014: I have the option for \"Cross-Region play\" on allowed, and I am not getting summoned at any decent pace. I\\'m in new game plus and I don\\'t know if everyone is like \"Forget it\" or what.. but, its kinda lonely when looking for help with bosses. And that\\'s another thing Fromsoftware really didn\\'t fix. Yeah you can get an AI to fight the boss with you, on most bosses I believe, but the AI just flipping gets manhandled by the enemy AI. So its useless for the most part. Its frustrating needing help.. and hell I can\\'t get it. And like I mentioned above, I have armor that\\'s +10 Alonne Knight armor.. and spider boss with its little flipping minions are two shotting me.\\n\\nUpdate #2\\nTheir is a part in the game, where having a key, will help you with a certain boss in New game plus. The boss being the prisoner lady. Aright, fair enough. To get to said key, you have to go through, basically a bell tower, EVERYTIME I have gotten invaded by one or two grey shades... Isn\\'t that wonderful? So I am being forced into PvP, I can\\'t find anyone to summon to aid me ( I have the cross region activated for hopefully more people?). But I need this key to make the fight a little easier. The boss fight with all the gargoyles, you can\\'t make it through without help, unless your just flipping lucky. I\\'ve come close to making it through by myself, but that last gargoyle always seems to nick me. And since your armor is made of paper even at +10 in Dark Souls 2, especially newgame +. This is a huge problem. I have +50 Endurance and +29 Vitality for weight management, plus the Third Dragon Ring, plus the Royal Soldier +1 Ring to cope with weight.. and much needed stamina.. and it just gets chewed through. I can\\'t tank properly because my stats are not allowing me to..\\n\\nThat being said, I was also thinking that Dark Souls 2, really reminds me of Castlevania both in its fighting mechanics, as well as its lore. In Castlevania series, the castle keeps coming back, like its a living entity or something. In Dark Souls 2 its like, hey the same thing keeps happening over and over..  It is different, but just by a little.\\n\\nAlso, Dark Souls 2, the fighting mechanics, even though they happen in a 3D environment, its a really 2D fighting style. Another words, you gotta try and dodge attacks, because two or three hits will kill you, just like in a 2d side scroller. And the enemies, even though you shoot them in the face with an arrow.. that should be a critical strike every single time.. you should be able to cripple any enemy in combat, by attacking their armors or something.. But we don\\'t get anything like that. So the combat really has this dated feeling to it. Enemies are weak to poison, fire, magic, and \"Hexes\".. which reminds me of a lot of Japanese RPG\\'s I\\'ve played, but not in a good way. You beat your enemies to death with a sword instead of actually cutting them. Combat is really dated, that\\'s what I am beginning to get from my playing experience.\\n\\nThe 3d world, is just not taken advantage of. Not enough innovations happening in the game.\\n\\nUpdate #3\\n\\nApparently even after defeating the area bosses you can still get invaded by grievers, (red spirits), now I knew you could with certain areas as a grey spirit. But this is flipping ridiculous.\\n\\nIf your like myself, and you enjoy co-op, this will be a big turn off. Now I could just go through new game again and see if its any different, or if this is because of patches. FromSoftware/BandaiNamco have basically enabled a bully system. Here you are, minding your own business trying to farm. And you get invaded by some douche bag, EVEN after defeating an area boss.\\n\\nAll these people who claim to like PvP, I\\'d say theirs a few amongst them who really do enjoy it, and those guys are the ones who put down red soapstones, or join the covenant where you can fight in an arena, against other individuals. All these other guys no they don\\'t like \"PvP\" they just like being the biggest grievers they can be...showing up at the worst possible time and screwing someone over. That\\'s what they enjoy. They know it, but most won\\'t admit it. And if they could invade the same person over and over second after second, they\\'d do it.\\n\\nUpdate #4\\nI get summoned in co-op, in the crypts, I am clear of enemies when summoned. My host gets killed by an trolly invader, game respawn\\'s me SMACK DAB in the middle of five syan soldiers.. I can\\'t even roll away. And they all just turn and slaughter me of course. I mean, against five.. it was just stun lock city.\\nI think this is horrid game design.

It becomes extremely fustrating, especially if you've got something and getting hotter and closer to cracking the case.  If it wasn't for all this lock up, the game would be great.  The game is worth 1 star, even if there was an option for no stars, it still is worth 1 the 1 star I gave it.\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 'negative'},\n",

              " {'guid': 891, 'text_a': \"The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is a great game for the Zelda fan.  This game follows the events that occurred after the Ocarina of Time.  Link is on the search for his fairy companion, Navi, who disappeared through a window in the Temple of Time after Link defeated Ganondorf.  After a confrontation with the Skull Kid, Link is sent to Termina and has three days to stop the Skull Kid from having the moon completely destroy Termina and Clock Town.  This game is really interesting because Link gets to re-live those three days over and over again, Groundhog Day style.  While this was initially a bit frustrating for me because you lose all the items you're carrying/rupees/dungeon keys/progress/etc each time you play the Song of Time,  it started growing me as I learned each town person's schedule, started enjoying the feeling of being rushed to complete a task, and started seeing the story unravel from different characters at different locations throughout those three days.\\n\\nOf the Zelda series I've played so far, this has the most dark story line - but it's also one of the most compelling.  The story line revolved a lot around death and redemption, and while it initially seemed a bit macabre, I really enjoyed seeing the stories unfold, and had a greater appreciation for each character.  This is definitely a game where the NPCs shine.  The game control is pretty much identical to the Ocarina of Time 3DS with much of the game control coming from the D pad as well as some touch pad elements.\\n\\nUnlike the Ocarina of Time, the boss battles were very easy in Majora's Mask.  Part of this stems from the fact that you will likely have to battle these bosses again in order to complete the many side quests, but part of it also stems from the fact that you're under tight time constraints.  For those of you who are familiar with the long drawn out Water Temple dungeons, you will likely have to play that Song of Time and lose everything, then replay everything again once you figure out where items are and how the puzzles operate.  Like I said, this time constraint can be frustrating at times, but for me, it grew on me as I started enjoying the added pressure.\\n\\nOverall, this is a really great game with an amazing story - I would definitely finish Ocarina of Time before playing this game, just to get all the little references made about OoT in this game.  The visuals are stunning, the game play is fun, and the characters are memorable.  This is a definitely a game you'll want to complete all the side quests in.  Seeing some of the NPC stories - particularly Anju and Kafei's story - are beautiful.  This is definitely a game worth considering.\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 'positive'},\n",

To let others know you likely won\\'t even need it.\\n\\nI have had my Wii now for 2 months and have used the Nunchuk exactly twice (and that was only on the included Wii Sports game).  I have since played mainly Mario Kart Wii, Super Mario Wii and Zelda and guess what?  The nunchuk is not needed to play them and in my opinion it actually hinders the game play when you try to play with it.  I was sucked into the marketing behind the Wii and bought an extra controller with motion plus and an extra nunchuk at the time of purchase, hind-sight 20/20 I really didn\\'t need the nunhuck or motion plus as the regular controller will be what I will likely ONLY use.\\n\\nThis review is in no way a reflection of the quality or performance of the Wii \"Nunchuk\" but should serve to let you know it would be wise to make sure you actually use the included Nunchuk before purchasing an additional one.', 'text_b': None, 'label': 'neutral'},\n",

I waited for the patches promised and upheavel in graphics and gameplay. That time has come and it's still just a terrible reboot to this classic franchise. I sadly, but honestly can say, that NBA Live 10 is light years better than this, and even 09 and 08 are more fun. It's probably as good in terms of fun factor than NBA Live 06 was which was a buggy mess too. The main problem is the game speed. It's robotic, slow and sloppy. Major clipping issues, zero fluidity and graphics are tremendously underwhelming. Both the Ps4 and XBOX1 versions could easily pass for a current gen game. In many ways, it looks worse than the 3-5 year old NBA Live games. It's got potential and the game can be somewhat fun at times, but again, it's just so lethargic. It's definitely not up to par with Madden and FIFA which actually are nice launch games for the systems. Other issues you'll notice is between the lines. There are no game sliders, no roster editing options, not very many modes, no FIBA, no team editing, no player creator, okay, you get it. It's lacking.\\n\\nNBA Live is back, but fans of this beloved franchise will want to skip this. I'm semi hopeful maybe NBA Live 15 (if they release it) might be competent.

              "['Recently UBISOFT had to settle a huge class-action suit brought against the company for bundling (the notoriously harmful) StarFORCE DRM with its released games. So what the geniuses at the helm do next? They decide to make the same mistake yet again - by choosing the same DRM scheme that made BIOSHOCK, MASS EFFECT and SPORE infamous: SecuROM 7.xx with LIMITED ACTIVATIONS!\\n\\nMASS EFFECT can be found in clearance bins only months after its release; SPORE not only undersold miserably but also made history as the boiling point of gamers lashing back, fed up with idiotic DRM schemes. And the clueless MBAs that run an art-form as any other commodity business decided that, \"hey, why not jump into THAT mud-pond ourselves?\"\\n\\nThe original FAR CRY was such a GREAT game that any sequel of it would have to fight an uphill battle to begin with (especially without its original developing team). Now imagine shooting this sequel on the foot with a well known, much hated and totally useless DRM scheme that turns it into another Rent-A-Game no one wants. Were I a UBISOFT stock-holder I would be ordering my broker to \"Sell-Sell!-SELL!!\" instead of posting this...\\n\\nEver since its 7.xx version, SecuROM has NOTHING to do with \"fighting piracy\". All it does in this direction (blocking certain optical and virtual drives) is a very old, lame and already bypassed attempt that serves as a thin smoke-screen. SecuROM is, in fact, an intruding and silent Data-Miner and Root-Hijacker that is delivered by means of popular games.\\nThat is why even the STEAM versions as well as the (free) Demos of such games are infected with it. SecuROM will borrow deep into our PC systems and will refuse to be removed completely even after uninstalling the game it came with. It will retain backdoor access and will keep reporting to its mothership.\\n\\nLately, these security concerns have been accentuated as known Trojans seem to be exploiting SecuROM\\'s backdoor access for their own purposes. In effect, installing a SecuROM-infected game in our computer will be placing your hardware and data at risk long after having uninstalled the game.\\n\\nAnd the latest vehicle to deliver this hazardous snoopware is FAR CRY 2 - a game crippled by LIMITED INSTALLATIONS! No, thanks. I think I \\'ll pass this one too.\\n\\nThe only people who do not care about SecuROM are, in fact,...pirates! Because cracking games \"protected\" by this contraption apparently is very easy. Every single game that was supposedly \"protected\" by SecuROM was cracked hours withing its release!\\nTo everyone else though, SecuROM (or StarFORCE or any other hazardous DRM scheme) is a core issue that needs to be resolved before PC gaming can evolve any further. And the best way to resolve such issues is market correction.\\n\\nThat is why it is important for gamers to keep voting with their wallets. And as with any vote, well informed decisions are paramount in making the right choice.',\n",
              " \"code didn't work, got me a refund.\",\n",

              " \"well let me start by saying that when i first started this game up i was so excited, but when i started playing OMG was i pissed off. The graphics where that of a xbox original, i am not joking they are some of the WORST graphics i have seen in a long time. NOT only are the graphics bad but the game play is not much better. Besides the fact that when you walk you look like you have something rather large in your butt making your player look VERY stiff, and has for the story, WAIT there was a story here??? well if there was anything to do with a story then i must have missed it, the so called story here is not at ALL good in fact it was just pain boring and luckily for me was VERY short beating it in under 2 hours. Ok now on to the level design, well lets just say that it was some of the worst i have seen. It goes like this, run into to dark boring room shoot a few bad guys or zombies then move to the next room that looks almost the same then repeat and do again for the next few hours. Ok so now i will move to the sound of the game, so the zombies when you kill them it sounds OK at best, but as for the sound of the guns WOW OMFG the worst EVER sounds weaker then a nerf guns!!!! the voice overs are very bad as well. Ok now onto the only kind of fun in this game, the only time i had ANY fun on this game was when i played with friends, but even still it was very boring. There is a ranking system that is mediocre at best, the more enemy's you kill the more XP you will get, and when you earn XP you can buy guns that won't really care to use because they all for the most part suck, or you can buy powers for the different players you can choose from. I would also like to add in the fact that when i you enemy it is almost completely random as to when they die, sometimes it will only take a few shoots to kill a simple solder and other time the same kind of enemy will take a clip and a half to kill, as well as that but the hit indication is very OFF. So i will wrap this up by saying this, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, rent it first to see for yourself. i hope someone can find fun in this game, but for me i could not find much fun here.\\n\\nI forgot to add in here that the AI IS THE WORST IN ANY GAME EVER. your team mates make no attempt whatsoever to avoid danger or even bother to shoot at the enemy, your friendly AI will spend the bulk of their time wasting ammo on a wall or ceiling if they are even shooting at ALL, the rest of the time they are just in your way block you in doorways or blocking your shots, never before have i ever seen AI worse than this. As for the enemy AI they are just as bad, half the time the enemy is just standing there as i am shooting them.\\n\\nSO this game is pretty much a FAIL on every level, its a broken game, But lets hope that resident evil 6 will make up for this REALLY REALLY BAD GAME\",\n",

              " 'UPDATE, 2010:  This review is pretty old, and now that we\\'re in 2010 and I\\'m on even better hardware, I\\'ve had a chance to revisit Halo 2.  I still ran into DRM issues with the re-install, and if you already have Games for Windows Live you\\'re going to find installing Halo 2 nearly impossible (I\\'ll post details in the comments)...but if you can get it going in Windows 7, things do get better.  In the past month or so, I only lost my savegames on the Live server twice and have only had it crash itself once.  That said, here is the original review.  I hope it is helpful for you.\\n\\nI bought Halo 2 for the PC excited about trying it on my brand-new Vista machine.  I have had it for over a year now and have yet to be able to actually play the game all the way through.\\nI went through the agony of having to create a Live account, and then having the game not \"see\" the account (but not let me log in because I\\'m \"already logged in\").  I experienced the unfun joys of having Halo 2 randomly tell me my savegame file is corrupted and I have to start again.  I had updates crash the game, my license key invalidate itself, and after unanswered support e-mails, it took me multiple calls and over 3 hours on the phone to get someone to fix the problem.  They had to do this by removing my license key, issuing me a new one, and telling me I\\'d lose all my \"achievements\" and account info.  That wasn\\'t a great loss, since the program would regularly log me into Live, then say, \"You are not logged into Live.  You will not be able to have any Achievements.  Sorry about that.\"  A lot of the messages I get in Halo 2 say, \"Sorry about that.\"  Sorry, indeed.\\n\\nBy the time I actually got the game to work (with shuddering framerate and random dropouts in sound), I was just angry.  Angry at all the \"Sorry\" messages, angry at the hassle I have to click through just to load a saved game, and angry at the constant savegame level resets.  I see new Microsoft Games for Windows titles, and I feel I\\'d be stupid to put risk putting myself through that again.',\n",

              " 'For the better part of an entire year, I was hyped up to this game.  The announcement that there would be no Knockouts was the only thing that soured me a bit.\\n\\nThen I read a Midway Q&A session on IGN.com regarding the game, and almost every response Midway gave either consisted of \"No, this game will not feature that\" or \"We hope to include that in the next game!\"\\n\\nMissing a lot of things though it may be, Midway showed just how much fail is in this product when they spend an opportunity to hype it up by basically crapping all over it and all but telling us \"don\\'t buy this yet---it\\'s only the beta version of the sequel coming in four or ten years~!\"\\n\\nThen the game itself.  The graphics are good, but what game isn\\'t these days?  You can\\'t give a game a pretty rating just for graphics alone---imagine how Final Fantasy: Spirits Unleashed would have been received if the graphics of the movie were considered a part of how good it was.\\n\\nEven then, the graphics look nowhere near as good as the now-apparent pre-rendered screenshots plastered across the internet.  I absolutely could not tell that James Storm character was supposed to be James Storm, while for the most part, all the wrestlers look how they\\'re supposed to, but don\\'t break the barrier of shock and awe.  They are more in the league of Smackdown vs Raw 2007 or 2008.\\n\\nThat said, compensation appears to be made for the above-average graphics, by immense cuts in game content.  25 superstars is no real big deal.  When all those superstars have the exact same generic taunts and the same puddle of moves to pick from, THAT is a big deal.  A bad big deal.\\n\\nThe controls are a sloppy and contorted mess.  Arguably this could be from a several year-long accustomment to the controls in WWE games from Day of Reckoning to Smackdown vs Raw 2008, but either way, it\\'s simply not very functional for the R button to be for running, and for the strong-grapple button to be on the opposite side of the controller from the base grapple button itself.\\n\\nThe controls are designed in such a way that it will take a very long time to grow accustomed to them, much less to master them.  Maybe this is due to my clumsiness and retard-fingers, but even I was able to get over the switch of L button for blocking strikes, R button for blocking grapples in SvR07 after a transition from WWE Day of Reckoning 2 (where it was the other way around) within a short while of gameplay.  As such, when you are thrust into the ring early on, your only chance of winning is the basic punch/kick/basic grapple until you can figure out how to do more complex maneuvers without the computer utterly destroying you while you stand around stupidly.\\n\\nThe moves actions in-game are indeed fluid, but only for as long as the opponent is standing.  As soon as they are knocked down and fail to immediately come back up, the fluidity is broken.  As far as I can tell, there is absolutely no way to pick your opponent up when they\\'ve fallen---only to stomp or punch them, drop elbows or whatever other thing, or do ground grapples involving the exact same arm locks and such.\\n\\nThe \"fluid\" motions as well must be fluid if you consider just how slowly they come about.  The controls do not react immediately, and once you\\'ve set about trying to perform a punch or a grapple, there is no going back.  As such, if you\\'re lightning-fast on your button mashing like I am, you\\'ll be angered to no end by how sloppily your character tries a meek little punch, only for the enemy to back away quickly, then come right back up and hit you while you\\'re still recovering from throwing that first punch.\\n\\nMidway apparently HAS reason to brag about how \"fluid\" their grapples are as well---there are only about two or three of them the player can perform!  Compared to the dozen or so that can be done in the WWE equivalent, the game pretty much only needs one button and two directions on the analog stick to fluidly perform the exact same suplex or jawbreaker or hurricanrana quickly and efficiently.\\n\\nCounters are apparently the only area where the uniqueness of TNA\\'s in-ring talent is on display.  Amazingly, the moves are all very ordinary and basic, whereas the counters show off some of the most insane, unique, and innovative maneuvers TNA wrestlers can do.  Counters.\\n\\nThe sound is terrible.  Obviously something like sound isn\\'t really of big importance to a game that does it right, but in this game they\\'ve really done something wrong for sound to get mention.  The audience has only three or four noises they make---and they are NOISES, because this crowd never quiets down or gets louder---the generic white noise of screaming, a gasping sound effect used millions of times in various movies and TV shows for the past hundred years, and slightly noisier, but no more louder, cheering.  The punch/kick sounds are comical in nature, sounding like something you\\'d hear in Street Fighter II or Final Fight for SNES.\\n\\nI COULD have given the game a two or even three star rating if not for the crux of the massive bag of issues this game is; the fact that the opponent will seemingly always be better than you no matter what, always.\\n\\nI started the game playing as Chris Sabin vs Shark Boy, and in said match, I was very new and experienced.  I tried a balanced workout of punches and kicks first, followed by experimenting with grapples, and trying to figure out how to do other grapple moves.  Not only did I utterly fail to do anything but snap suplexes, but because I was kicking the crap out of Shark Boy with only the most basic of moves, he easily countered some of them, built up a full iMPACT! bar, and performed his finisher and pinned me for three.\\n\\nThe next match I was AJ Styles vs Rhino.  This bout went even shorter, as despite the fact that we both battled each other equally, my pins barely made two, whereas Rhino\\'s one pin got me at 3 in less than 3 minutes.\\n\\nThen I go to story mode, where the most damning thing happens:  I spend a good 15 minutes utterly destroying this obese clown named \"Benny\" or some generic name like that, with 80% of all strikes and moves in this match being done by me on him, and I grab him up in my finisher and pin him, and he kicks out.  After a more sustained and concentrated beating, not only does he kick out AGAIN, but he manages to pull off his finisher on ME and PIN ME FOR THREE!  After getting in almost NO offense, he somehow BEATS ME!\\n\\nThis happened THREE TIMES IN A ROW!  After finally beating him somehow, I move on, and THE SAME THING HAPPENS!  I squash my next opponent, and yet they perform enough moves on me (seven moves on me out of 6000 on him is still enough to get you a full iMPACT! bar) to perform his finisher and beat me.\\n\\nUPDATE: This only seems to get worse as you progress in storyline, as bigger-name stars are even bigger jerkasses to beat, as in one scenario where I LITERALLY squashed James Storm (as in, got over 90% of the matches\\' offensive moves placed on him), and just because he managed to counter 10% of my moves, HE is able to get a finisher, hit it on me, and pin me for three.  Trying to break out of a pin by wiggling the control stick is such a frantic ordeal, I\\'ve cut the skin of my palm just trying to keep an opponent down for a pin by wiggling the control stick.  Or rather, smashing it back and forth wildly.\\n\\nThis is pure BS.  When you\\'re pinned, the game gives you a motion of the analog stick wiggling back and forth in order to break the pin.  The only problem is it doesn\\'t tell you WHICH analog stick this is, and \"wiggling it gently\" is as effective as not wiggling it at all---you have to ram it back and forth as fast as you can.\\n\\nAnd so, Midway releases to us a Beta test of a future release.  And it is a great many things; and many of those things are what was once just a verb, but has now become a noun as well: Fail.',\n",

If it weren't for the shoddy control and ridiculous save points, I would be sharing the opinions of every reviewer out there and say this game is a 5 out of 5 or a 9.5 out of 10 like IGN. Unfortunately, cool graphics, a great map, wonderful environments, super smooth 60FPS and a compelling story does not make up for the fact that you will be fighting the godawful controls all the way through.\\n\\nAdmittedly , this game is from 2002--which would be the infancy of first person shooters on Consoles. This hardly excuses not using the damn second stick on the Gamecube controller to make this game livable!! Sure, the left trigger locks on which is great to straff and blast through enemies. The problem comes when you have to shoot at things which the game does not consider enemies--like exploding mushrooms, or that rapidly respawning killer grass, or the hives where those big flying bugs come out of. AIming is nearly impossible!! You hold the right trigger and try to move the left stick(the only stick used for control in this game) praying beyond everything that the damn reticule will stay in one place. YOU see the cursor does not stop when you release pressure on the stick!! So you have to do minute motions with the stick and basically fire blindly until random chance has the reticule go over the item you want to shoot at.\\n\\nAll of these things were bearable for the first 5 or 6 hours of the game(I explored every nook and cranny I was loving the game so much) The first few bosses were not too bad and then I got to a big bug boss who would recharge with these mirrors. Here is the method. You shoot this boss(for some reason the lock on was very shoddy for this boss) until he gets kind of winded. You then have to shoot a little red spot on the base of the mirror(Sorry for the spoilers but if you want to play this game, you are probably not going to want to read this review anyway right?) To destroy the mirror you have to hold the fire button to do a power shot at it. But the aim is so crappy that you miss half the time!! The first boss of the game was real easy and you could lock and jump sideways. Not sure why but that method did not work with this boss and he absolutely raped me time and time again.\\n\\nTo make matters ever worse, this game uses Save spots. This would be okay if the damn save spots were right next to the boss. NOOOOO. YOu respawn way the hell away from the boss and have to do a 5 minute platforming section to get back to him. Why do Japanese games not believe the the checkpoint system? Please tell me why??????\\n\\nUggh. I think I am just too used to modern games which are a lot more forgiving.

Is that too much to ask!?\\n\\n2. The actual adventures your guy goes through get mind-numbingly repetitive, even if you\\'re playing through the game for just the first time. Nearly every encounter is based on the \"cage match\" paradigm: your character trips some sort of switch, whereupon some sort of of walls come up, and some sort of monsters continue spawning until you manage to trip another sort of switch, whereupon the walls come down and you are allowed to continue. Yawn.\\n\\n3. You cannot control the camera at all, as you can in many games of this type. This is a shame, since there are some good visuals along the way. This drawback gets pretty infuriating in some of the puzzles where you need to move the camera around a bit to get a good sense of what you\\'re looking at. Heck, even when it\\'s not a question of a puzzle, the camera is awfully dumb about framing relevant elements. As a result of this, the game has a very restricted, cramped feel, since what you get depends not on what your character needs to see or logically would see (e.g., the ledges he\\'s jumping from and to), but rather what the camera wants to do to best showcase the background art.\\n\\n4. The \"easy mode\" really isn\\'t . . . the monsters are easier to kill, but since nothing has been done about the timed puzzles and jumping challenges (i.e, the spike room, flying through the tunnels), they still manage to infuriate everybody.\\n\\n5. The actual combat is exceedingly dull, although it may not look like it to somebody watching the game. (I frequently put this game on pause to get my algebra homework done).  Although there are a plethora of combos available, nearly all monsters -- including all boss monsters -- can be safely dispatched by simply pressing the same button over and over again.\\n\\n6. This game has no business forcing you to go through a whole bunch of jumping and swinging challenges since its graphics and shading aren\\'t good enough to tell where your character is (e.g., remember jumping behind Athena\\'s bed?). Most of the time this is because the lighting source (and therefore the shadows) are illogical, so it\\'s difficult to gauge distance and height. Consequently, success in the game\\'s many jumping puzzles boils down to just a matter of luck and memorization, not skill. Also, the logic of the distances you can leap to seems to change depending on the camera angle: sometimes, you can leap vast chasms; other times, you can barely hop over a puddle.\\n\\n7. I hate watching the same cutscenes over and over again. Why doesn\\'t this game let you skip them?\\n\\n8. The storyline is preposterous. The Olympians are immortal! How can they be killed? And how can you kill people who are already in Hades? And does it make sense that Kratos would be making so much headway on overthrowing the gods of Olympus when he even can\\'t jump over an effin\\' puddle!? The gods woulda just teamed up and squashed him like a bug!\\n\\n9. The weapons you get have some grandiose names (e.g., \"Bow of Apollo,\" \"Claws of Hades\"), but they\\'re quite ineffectual, even against garden-variety zombies. If you\\'re fighting a run-of-the-mill skeleton and it takes like 50 hits to kill him, it\\'s time for a new weapon. (I love how the much-vaunted \"Bow of Apollo\" has about as much oomph as a spitwad.)\\n\\n10. Curse you, Yu Suzuki, or whoever invented QTEs (Quick Time Events). I hate them. (These are the times when it\\'s basically a cut scene but you have to press the X button or the O button at the right time.) What is this, the fourth grade? Are we learning to identify shapes this week? Another problem with these is that you can\\'t focus on the cool graphics at all, since you\\'re waiting for the next prompt with gimlet eyes. QTEs need to be outlawed!\\n\\n11. This game is far too violent for my taste!  It just got to the point where you didn\\'t want to enter QTEs when an opponent was on its last legs since you know the visuals are going to be gross. If this had been a movie, it probably would have received an X for violence.  I mean, you\\'re graphically pulling folk\\'s heads off and stuff  Couldn\\'t they have at least included a \"BLOOD OFF\" option, like they did in Assassin\\'s Creed II?\\n\\n12.  Game is not kind to you if you haven\\'t played the first two installments.  You\\'ll be baffled as to what\\'s going on until at least halfway through the game.',\n",

              " 'Harvest Moon: A Tale of Two Towns was my first time playing a Harvest Moon game.  I am a longtime fan of the Animal Crossing series and I always wanted to try out Harvest Moon but never got around to it.  Unfortunately, my first experience with this series was not a pleasant one.  I initially enjoyed starting out in my town of choice (Bluebell), learning to cook, tend to livestock, catch critters, and plant crops. After several in-game days of play I was walking around the mountain and all of a sudden the game shut down for no apparent reason with only a message stating that \"an error occurred.\" Since I bought the game used, I tried cleaning it off and starting up again.  It appeared to work for several more in-game days.  After a lot of in-game \"work\" a few hours later, it happened again. I\\'m walking around the mountain and \"an error occurred.\"  Instead of trying to exchange the game right away, I looked online first. To my dismay, it turned out to be a critical design flaw with this game in general and not a problem with my cartridge.  As others have mentioned, you can only save the game by ending your in-game \"day\" and going to bed.  This means you could have just caught a rare critter, sold a lot of items and completed quests and all of a sudden you lose it all at random and go back to your last save.\\n\\nI have also heard a lot about Natsume deleting customer comments off of their website instead of trying to fix the problem or issue refunds.  I for one am getting sick and tired of the recent industry standards of pumping out every untested piece of junk to meet a deadline rather than worrying about customer service or producing quality software.  This isn\\'t the only game it is happening to - Borderlands 2 has been experiencing major data loss issues for months, and that continues to go unfixed even though they continue to sell new DLC for the game.  There is no excuse for this type of thing and yet it continues to happen.\\n\\nNatsume has suggested that you try picking up all items before changing screens on the mountain, not playing the livestock petting game more than 5 times per in-game day, and shutting down the game in between every in-game day to reduce incidents of freezing. Ummmmm, NO.  That isn\\'t a fix, that is a royal pain.  I shouldn\\'t have to work around their design flaws.  This game is simply unplayable.\\n\\nAt the end of it all I returned Harvest Moon: A Tale of Two Towns and exchanged it towards Harvest Moon: A New Beginning (the newer one). I still want to give this series a try because I genuinely liked the game other than the freezing thing.  I am not going to review the gameplay of Tale of Two Towns in this review because I see no point in it.  The freezing flaw is unacceptable and it ruins the game for me.  Hopefully A New Beginning also provides a better and more reliable experience.',\n",
              " \"I really tried to like this game. I thought I would give it a try because it was a the second in the series. Surely if it was popular enough to get a second game to come over to america then there must be something to it that must draw people in, right? Is it the odd concept for a game? Was it the fighting? The dating? I had to know what it was that drew people in, so I went out and bought the limited edition and tried it. After playing for 30 hours I can say that I have no idea. The dungeons are repetitive, the girls are very much the clich female types in a harem games and the main character is very much a Marty Stue. The kids were adorable, but I did not have much attachment to them because the main character cycled through them so fast and they had no characterization/backstory. The battle system was also very repetitive and I had no incentive to go to the next dungeon, I only did because the plot told me to. Grinding was unnecessary because the bosses never gave me much of a challenge, however if you wanted to get in good with the girls I found that it was almost necessary to enter the dungeons more than was needed. Forced grinding made me lose interest to stop playing it early even though I feel like I am near the end.\\nDating was so easy; give the girl a gift and answer correctly (though, answering correctly did not matter that much because if you choose the wrong answer you could just come back, give a gift and make it all better) the multiple choice options. Which is typical for a dating-style game, but not entirely inventive and hardly the thing I would imagine to bring players to this game. It was scarily easy to woo even the most stubborn of the girls which made it hard to feel like I accomplished something by the end.\\nI understand it is an interesting concept, but the battle system, plot and character descriptions could have been written by a 5 year old. I would not have minded the fact that the girls were so fanservice-y if the game itself was even slightly interesting. I find I can't finish this game. After this many hours I feel like the plot should pick up and I should not feel like I am doing the same exact things as I was 20 hours ago. beautiful artwork and cutscenes; very bad game. I would have been okay if this was just a show rather than a game.\",\n",

Should have listened to day 1 reviews from the other major critic review website showing 120 positives but 100 negatives. Bad sign. First I was fooled by the hype of Titanfall, then Diablo III, and now this.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Nice graphics, sound, and gameplay.\\n- Adventure/light RPG elements.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Just plain not fun and very boring. That goes for the main modes of the campaign which feels like all the missions are just the same.\\n- Same for vs multiplayer. Not much difference in playing the levels. No variety?... No large 8 vs 8, 12 vs 12, etc. No CTF. No TDM. No invade the base types.\\n- Lots and lots of rinse and repeat campaign missions or objecives leading to it being repetitive. Too much being the same. Same for multiplayer.\\n- Playing by yourself is a horrible and extremely boring experience. I played a couple campaign levels with some randoms and it was a little more fun. I play online w/ a dozen close friends and family but NONE of them wanted this game so playing vs multiplayer wasn't fun and was boring. Probably would have had more fun playing campaign w/ close friends and family.\\n- Nothing special or exciting when doing anything in the game from start to finish. Walking around the planets, talking to people in the city, picking up new equipment, getting new weapons, campaign missions, and vs multiplayer. Found myself going back to my laptop, tablet, phone, or just dozing off/falling asleep on my couch.\\n- Online only. I have a couple friends that love campaign games but didn't know it can't be played offline. Dumb.\\n- Kicked you out for being idle. Very annoying you can't pause the game. Sometimes I'm in the middle of a mission but like to do things like start laundry, take a long bathroom break, or fix something to snack on for a few minutes. I come back and I got kicked out to the main menu for being too idle. Dumb. I'm in the middle of mission to get up a few min now I have to start over.\\n- Peter Dinklage as the main commentator is horrible and sounds very boring. Love him as an actor.

              " 'Edit: 10/6/2014 - I ended up returning this unit a week after I bought it.  It stopped reading my sega genesis controllers, and I refuse to use the infra-red ones that come packed-in.  I would file this under \"too good to be true.\" Some units might work consistently (based on the reviews) but it seems to be VERY 50/50.  As a result, I\\'m changing my previous rating from 2 stars to 1.  Don\\'t waste your time.\\n\\nTo break it down simply, let\\'s start with pros and cons:\\nPros:\\n1) Composite video output is crisp and clean\\n2) My Sega Genesis controllers work\\n3) My Genesis cartridges work\\n4) Packed-in genesis games play as good as their physical counterparts\\n\\nCons:\\n1) Infrared controllers\\n2) Sound is poor quality and wrong pitch\\n\\nThe cons greatly outweigh the pros, even though there are more \"pros\" than \"cons.\"\\n\\nThe fact that they made these controllers infrared limits their usefulness - or more accurately, renders them useless - because IR requires a clear line of sight and is not exactly known for responsiveness.  IR works great for TV remotes because reflexive and repetitive button pressing is not required for watching TV.  They simply made the controllers IR to cut costs and say they have wireless controllers.  It would have been just as cheap (and more reliable) if they\\'d packed in wired controllers.  After reading the reviews, I didn\\'t even bother with putting the batteries in...I simply know better.\\n\\nThe sound chip is tuned to the wrong frequency.  For those less technically inclined, it means that everything (music and sound effects) play at a lower pitch than normal, like a cassette walkman when the batteries are low.  It might play at the right tempo, but the pitch is distinctly lower.  For folks that used to own a Genesis, or played the Genesis collections that have come out over the past 10 years, this is very distracting.\\n\\nThat said, I put in my Ghouls & Ghosts cartridge and my Sega Genesis controller, and gave the system a system a legitimate go.  The lower-pitch music made the game more haunting and creepy, but some of the higher-pitched sound effects (or sounds that were SUPPOSED to be higher-pitch) were crackly as the poor sound chip tried to crunch them out.  The buttons were sometimes non-responsive, but that is likely because my controller is from 1990.\\n\\nAfter playing a couple stages in Ghouls & Ghosts, I played Sonic & Knuckles on the system itself.  Navigating the menus was simple and straightforward. Each game had a brief description, instructions, and a screen shot of their respective games.  Given the general cheap quality of this system, I feel like some kind of effort did go into making it a reality.\\n\\nI don\\'t dislike the system, but I can\\'t in good conscience recommend it. Paying $35 for wrong-sounding games, even with the packed-in games as a bonus, just isn\\'t worth it when you can buy Sonic\\'s Ultimate Sega Genesis Collection on PS3/360 for $10 and an old Sega Genesis off of ebay for $10.\\n\\nThis console would be perfect if they had:\\nA) Done quality testing to recognize the sound chip was wrong\\nB) Included 2.4 GHz wireless controllers or wired controllers.\\n\\nI don\\'t dislike it enough to return it, but I will say that the pricepoint doesn\\'t warrant the sacrifices made on the manufacturer\\'s part, and so I have to give this console a 2-star rating for the two \"cons\" of this console, and take a third star off for the cut corners.',\n",
              " \"Simply put, this isn't Halo. This is Call of Duty using Halo's premise. Strategy is gone, all you do is run around with a DMR and kill people with 3 shots.

Pretty much everybody who likes CoD duty gives this game praise. Halo has lost what made it Halo.\\n\\nEdit: I am getting some heat from fanboys so I'll list a few reasons here why the game sucks:\\n\\n-killcam is either glitched, or the game's hitbox is completely wrong. The killcam shows your killer shooting at walls and clearly missing you during kills.\\n\\n-vehicle animations seem unfinished. Watch a Wraith blow up... just wow.\\n\\n-AI intelligence is at an all time low. Throughout the campaign I had the easist time running down enemies. They don't even move sometimes.

Now i am finally reviewing this and sadly it is a 1 start for me and my oldest son.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n\\nThe game has issues for us.  He has had enemies go into areas that he cannot get to and still was able to shoot him.  These are failed missions because you cannot take them all out.  I saw this in the beta way back and this was an issue for him only 2 days ago (from this review).\\n\\nI have had sound issues where everything sounds muffled.  In these instances the frames can drop sometimes.  But the biggest issue is the guns do little to no damage at all.  Case in point:\\n\\n-Today I was playing a mission.  I had already done a lot of side missions and was way ahead of the level requirement.  I also play on hard and have a fairly easy time with the single player content.  I get to a point where I am defending with a timer.  The sound messes up on the last enemy and no way to damage said enemy.  This leads to spawn after spawn at this point with no damage to enemies.  I finally exit the game and reload.  Starting at the beginning.\\n\\n-After restarting the mission I am going along and I find that I pass the problem point easily (on hard) and get to the final boss of that mission.  At this point I get the odd sound problem and the guns do no damage.  Long mission and a little disheartening.  I die 4 times.  On the fifth spawn the game puts me on a screen where my character and the games level assets are greyed instead of full color.  My character is walking in place and is aiming to the side but has not weapon in hand.  I am playing single player but the game says \"Waiting for Revive\" on the screen.  No option at all but to exit the game.  I could not fast travel to a safe house.  I could not spawn again.  Nobody could join me to hopefully break me free to finish the mission\\n\\nThe above is just one major issue I have had.  Others:\\n\\n-Enemies invisible.\\n-Enemies in walls or other inaccessible places\\n-Not able to pick up look <--Very bad because I have had drops of much better weapons and cannot pick them up with on 15 of 46 inventory full\\n-Weapon parts that show on map are not there.  They were there for my son but on my play some are just not showing.  Even though they are on the map\\n-My son has had connection issues as well with friends who he was playing with.

Even so, what was barely palatable for a RED ALERT game is outright insulting for a TIBERIUM one.\\nIf his tanks could still run-over infantry units, have no doubt, he would hunt down whoever did this to him.\\nBecause, you cannot mock Kane and avoid having your lungs infused with Tiberium fumes!\\n\\nMORE UNITS? PLEASE WAIT BEHIND THE YELLOW LINE. FOREVER.\\nOne of the most annoying features of the new C&C4 is the units cap. You cannot produce more units above a (very low) number. Upgrading your tech-tree with such a unit cap in place means you have to kill and replace most of your units - and make painful decisions as some units are more equal than others. It feels like having to deal with a (small) Diablo-like inventory: whatever does not fit within the grid must be left behind to rot.\\nAnd to add insult to injury, extra units are bestowed with a dropper. A tiny one.\\nThis cap reeks of one thing: an attempt to turn this series into a Massively Multiplayer Online Game (fewer units means less lag).

The graphics aren't very good compared to the PSX or even some of the better stuff on the Saturn, like Panzer Dragoon Saga or Virtua Fighter 2, the Shenmue Saturn demo, Sega Rally, and Daytona Championship Circuit Edition, to name a few. Lots of games I've played have very low resolution textures, often sprawled out. The games themselves just aren't very interesting or fun to play, even in multiplayer.\\n\\nI'm also not a huge fan of the controller. While it has an odd design, it is fairly comfortable, and the joystick is very precise.\\n\\nFinally, there's the value. The games themselves are not at all worth the high prices they demand. Super Smash Brothers simply isn't as fun as Powerstone or Bushido Blade. Mario Kart 64 isn't as much fan as Ridge Racer Type 4 or Crash Team Racing. Mario Golf is nowhere near as good as Neo Turf Masters. Hell, even Mario isn't as fun as the Crash Bandicoot games. And just about all of the games listed (with the exception of Powerstone 1 or 2) are all marginally cheaper than their N64 competitors.\\n\\nFor the final verdict, this is a system I would recommend avoiding. The prices are far too high for their own good, and the games aren't good enough to justify the prices.

If they would've just done a fall of cybertron remastered edition with a few more levels in campaign I would've been much happier.\\n\\nFall of cybertron was the best transformers game I had ever played and multiplayer wise it was the best experience I had with conquest, escalation, capture the flag, and my favorite of course the deathmatch. True player on player competition.\\n\\nHopefully they could redeem themselves by creating a patch and adding these modes.\\n\\nThey also removed the customization of your own unique bots.\\n\\nEdge of reality basically hurt the high moon series badly.\\n\\nThat being said there are a few additions that are welcome but lack of new weapons, killing the multiplayer, and not a big jump in graphics it falls short dramatically. If I was an executive for activision I would be pushing the development team to build a patch to release to make up for this failure of a rushed product. Games can still be fixed, updated, and made better after the launch with PSN. If a patch comes out addressing these issues it could be a great game until then it's the only transformers game available on PS4.\\n\\nIf you loved the multiplayer of fall of cybertron you will be disappointed. If you haven't played any of the foc series and are a newbee that doesn't care about online gaming you might like this game a lot. If you are a kid under 13 you probably won't care and enjoy it as a transformers game.\\n\\nI hope this puts it into perspective for you. Please leave some feedback or comments.\",\n",

              " 'We were more than patient with you with BF 1942 because it was revolutionary and eventually the patches caught up and there was expansion goodness for everyone.\\n\\nWe were forgiving with BF Vietnam for the balancing, bugginess, lack of standard features, and maps just so we could have all the helicopter goodness.\\n\\nWe were excited and then quickly disappointed by BF 2 with all the same problems showing up yet a third time along and a lacking of features promised in the last two versions along with a crop of other things such as rampant cheating and patch updates that were almost non-existant.\\n\\nI\\'ll admit we\\'re a bit slow, but if you think we\\'re going to throw money yet a fourth time your way, for what amounts to a mod, a buggy mod at that, with the great new feature being adware, wow you\\'re dumber than we are.\\n\\nI for one am going to pass.  I\\'ll check back in six months, if it lasts that long.  Hopefully by then all the patches and balancing will be done.  If that is the case, then I\\'ll think about picking it up.\\n\\nJUST TO BE FAIR\\n\\nJust be fair I went back and gave it another try. Here is how it went.\\n\\nAnother 22 hour download. Nice\\nReintstalled Dx9\\nReinstalled game\\nGame crashed first attempt, but came up second time no problems.\\nI see that the jump to center, bug/characteristic is still in the control menu, annoying, but tollerable. It\\'s been there since the 1942 version.\\nGetting the control menu to keep my settings took a few attempts. For some reason it was dead set on keeping W set to nothing. I don\\'t use WASD I use ESDF, more keys to the left to use. Similar problems setting up the joystick and mouse, but nothing serious, just had to play a game solo and jump into the menu 10-15 times to keep changing things back, again another characteristic that has been with us since 1942.\\nVideo is similar to BF2, as long as I don\\'t max them out it is very smooth.\\n\\nNo widescreen support, big thumbs down. Closest thing to 1900x1200 is 1600x1200. Some warping, but playable. Sorry kiddies who think wide screen is cheating, I like my 24\" monitor and like having a wider view.\\n\\nThe optimizing shaders annoyance is back from BF2. If you change video setting expect a 5 minute or more wait till it optimizes something. Don\\'t know why this couldn\\'t be done before you try to enter a map in the background, so you are going to be late to the fight the first time after a change.\\n\\nGame play that I tried was Titan. Interesting concept, though nothing original it\\'s been around since the days of UT and RtCW. Moving around and launching aircraft onboard the Titan is buggy quite a bit of the time. The ship moves around subtly causing things to get hung up.\\nWeapons seem to be more accurate, but classes feel kind of generalized due to the reduction in total numbers.\\nSound quality is still pretty muted and generic, all the weapons sound alike, but at least they\\'ve finally figured out what 3d sound is. You know which way it\\'s coming from now.\\n\\nThe powered lift craft, they\\'re not helicopters, they\\'re not airplanes. It feels like they\\'re found the perfect dumbed down sensitivity. BFV they were crazy sensitive, BF2 they felt like you were flying with your hands numb. I personally like things light and sensitive, it took a lot of skill to fly them, but this should help get people up to speed faster and make people less afraid of jumping in with random pilots.\\n\\nLooks like the helicopter instant roll over and play dead bug is still in the game.\\n\\nThe ground vehicles are so so. The weapons have some interesting characteristics, like the curve ball grenades on the walker. Other than that nothing really new.\\n\\nLot\\'s of gun stabilization on vehicle guns finally make accurate passenger support fire possible while on the move.\\n\\nThere is no cover or vegetation which to speak of, but then none of the BF games ever have had much. I like the fatigue bar, but it\\'s a LONG run between things to hide behind, so anyone on foot is still going to be constantly caught out in the open.\\n\\nThe indestructable chain link fences make a return to the game ready to stop your 80 ton tank dead in it\\'s tracks.\\n\\nLight vehicles aren\\'t all that fast and explode almost instantly upon contact with water. Seems even in the future that is still a problem. The walker can wade accross no problems.\\n\\nI saw one of the infamous billboards. It was green and simple said \"The Enemy is out there\" So right they are, but I didn\\'t notice any more than that. No adds. I\\'d rather if they were going to stuff adds in the game to have them in the menu while you are looking for a server to join rather than in the game. The classic \"Brought to you by Brand X\" type placements there would be less strange.\\n\\nThis game feels very much like a mod, it still needs some tweeking to get some things right. The Menu system is still quirky, but seems to be actually stable, which is an absolute first for any BF game. Simple things like not telling you how to set up a joystick are still absent. It\\'s not hard, but it\\'s not obvious either.\\n\\nThere is nothing that interesting to a long time BF vet to make me want to pay money for it. I find the whole thing kind of boring. There are better games out there that suck you into the action better. It seems that DICE didn\\'t bother lifting any ideas from the many games that have come out since they have come onto the scene.\\n\\nI downgrade my opinion from flame to yawn.\\n\\nWars are dirty, loud, confusing, overwhelming, and dented. This game delivers none of that. Even BF2 for all it\\'s warts still seems to be the much better game.',\n",

              " '8 reasons Thief is the worst game I\\'ve played so far of this new generation:\\n\\n1 - VISIBILITY\\nthe game is so dark i can barely see anything half the time. there is no in-game brightness slider - the game tells you to use YOUR OWN display to adjust brightness. what? just for this one stupid game? then adjust it back for everything else I use it for? and back-n-forth and back-n-forth constantly over-and-over again? that\\'s incredibly inconvenient and flat out stupid. it didn\\'t matter, the game was impossible for me to get through so I had to do it just to be able to see where I was. after adjusting the brightness and contrast, I still struggle to see anything properly and whatever beauty I\\'m supposed to be witnessing is now completely washed out. this game may end up being the one that has actually physically harmed me (my eyes) the most...Note: I use a projector but there is NO issue with my display as ALL other games function as they should (BEING ABLE TO SEE THEM!) We joked as I went through, \"wow, progressive values have really taken hold. I never thought I\\'d be able to play a game developed BY BLIND PEOPLE!!!!\" Others in the room joked, \"they should have called THIS game \\'The Darkness\\'\"\\n\\n2 - CINEMATICS\\nat the end of the first level the game completely froze during what was obviously (based on the latter dialog of other characters) a VERY IMPORTANT cut scene. i completely missed what happened in the story as a result. Something happened to the main female character. alive? dead? missing? were there bad guys there? did they kill, abduct her? me? something happened to me...I have no idea what the hell happened - that scene is gone...stupid. at the end of the game, you beat a boss (the battle itself is a bit stupid). You go from beating the boss in the middle of a ship, to a confounding cinematic in which the boss is somehow dramatically hanging on a ledge of the ship (like at the end of Die Hard) nowhere near where they once were (did they teleport?)...as the 7-year-old in the room remarked \"why does that even matter, there\\'s water below\"). The boss acted as if they would fall to their death. Why? The fall looked like 20 feet at the most and into gentle water. Can they not swim?\\n\\n3 - TONE\\nthe main character seems to have 2 tones, sarcastic and sarcastic a-hole. actually that describes everyone\\'s character. what motivation is supposed to propel the gamer through toward the end? why steal everything? for what? to live in the worst, most miserable city ever? It\\'s like a medieval Detroit. The Theives Guild series of quests in Skyrim, which were somewhat generic, at least made some kind of sense...you\\'ll stole a bunch of stuff to restore the guild to it\\'s former glory and rose in it\\'s ranks...but why are we here in Thief? we appear to be stealing everything not nailed down, even from poor harmless victims...for what? so now the city will even be worse? not much back story to explain the main character\\'s motivations. I liked or sympathized with 0 characters in this game. if you nuked it from orbit, I wouldn\\'t care, nor would you...probably nor would they....\\n\\n4 - NAVIGATION\\nthe map is utterly useless, even counter-intuitive. if you can\\'t remember how to get back to such-n-such place (which will happen regularly as quests are assigned) and consult the map, the map may lead you into a solid wall, a complete closed off area, etc... you also continuously LOSE the smaller corner map every time you save, transition, etc. Annoying. Also annoying are the multiple button presses that it takes to get to the big map. as the map isn\\'t very pretty or inspiring, at least they should have made it useful. the map coupled with struggling to be able to see things properly made getting from point A-to-B maddening. Navigation and mobility, which you\\'d think you\\'d want to be functioning well as you\\'re a thief, are the biggest (unintentional) challenges in the game.\\n\\n5 - DIALOG\\ndialog is idiotic and repetitive. all the characters bitch that they wish they had some coffee. is this world barren of coffee? robotic character animations are repetitive. if you have subtitles turned on, you\\'ll see inaudible dialog repeated over and over and over. i turned it off. the audio is weird in many places. you\\'ll overhear characters that are supposed to be inside (giving you clues as to where treasures are), as clear as day...\\n\\n6 - RESPAWN\\nenemies annoyingly constantly re-spawn (similar to Farcry2). no way to get rid of them permanently. once you feel like you\\'ve stealthfully gotten past them once or twice in the proper ghostly way, you\\'ll get bored of that...I ended up just running past most of them for the rest of the game...combat isn\\'t particularly interesting. you can fire an arrow or 2 or hit someone with a sap. and that\\'s it.\\n\\n7 - STEALING\\nthe game\\'s called Thief, so hows the stealing part? pretty mundane. it\\'s not particularly broken. but it isn\\'t unique or interesting relative to other games. sneak past dude. crawl. sneak past some other dude. steal thing. unlock thing. steal other thing...sneak and escape. unlocking stuff is a simple affair. rotate thumb stick...based on some of the other fundamental things being completely broken (being able to see, navigation), I\\'m actually glad they didn\\'t decide to do some extravagant unique auteur idea here...it probably would have completely misfired...\\n\\n8 - COMPETITION\\nthe game\\'s natural competitors are Assassin\\'s Creed, Dishonored, Hitman, and other similar stealth-based titles like the original Splinter Cell...Thief has NOTHING over any of these games. Not even 1 unique bullet point or thing-that-works-better or aesthetic or anything at all...Go play those games instead. I can\\'t compare it to other games in the Thief franchise. I haven\\'t played them. This entry does not make me want to...\\n\\nCOMPLETE UTTER FAILURE',\n",

It\\'s a standard FPS shooter, made a bit more exiting by the 3D landscape engine which allows the action to take place across large outdoor environments.\\nThe emphasis is on \"real-world\" fighting - where taking a couple of shots will kill you, and so you spend most of the time creeping around hoping not to be discovered.\\nThere are plenty of gadgets to play with too. The Satelite camera allows you to view the action around you from above, and zoom in on activity in outdoor areas. When you use the camera, the map is shown full-screen and the action caries on around you in \"real-time\". If you\\'re not careful you can get killed while looking at the map.\\nThis \"real-world\" emphasis can be great (try games like SWAT3), but the game designers need to finely balance \"reality\" with \"fun\".

This game is the epitome of stress. It's chaotic and ultraviolent. It starts off a little slow... But the transition is quick. It goes from slow to full throttle in about 5 seconds, and stays at full throttle for the rest of the game. It's like driving a nice scenic route on the California coastline, but at 200 mph. So you miss the scenery, you miss the immersion, you just hold on for the hell of holding on.\\n\\nIt could have been more immersive. But the immersion is lost immediately. There are carnival games you can play and people to talk to in the first bit of the game. First bit being the first five minutes. However as soon as you pass through a certain gate, the mayhem begins.\\n\\nThe enemy AI is erratic at best. You're under attack from quite literally everyone. Police. Firemen. Gun turrets. Religious Zealots. And everyone has a gun. Why you're under attack is silly. You're the Anti-Christ. You get a pistol and shot gun and everyone else has either an assault rifle or a flame thrower. You're basically screwed from the get go.\\n\\nThere is no map. So you don't know where you're supposed to go. There is no sort of radar so the enemies have the upper hand no matter what. They outgun you in strength and numbers and you have no idea where they are. I get that some people may be into that sort of thing, but frankly I found it to be stressful and frustrating at best.\\n\\nThe controls are janky as all hell. You aim your gun by clicking the joystick you move with. So you either aim by accident or move while you're trying to aim. There are no sights on your guns either. So you basically shoot from the hip even if you aim.\\n\\nApparently you have psychic powers but using them is usually the result of pressing the wrong button thus using up the psychic powers and not having them available when you need them. I kept pressing the button that usually used for aiming (in EVERY OTHER FPS) only to find out that I've used up my psychic powers and now I can't hack that gun turret that's shooting me in the back.\\n\\nThey gaming itself was so shallow that I didn't even care about the story. So don't ask.\\n\\nSo I know a lot of people might read this and say that I suck at the game. In my opinion this game was just poorly designed. I played the first two Bioshocks. They were ok. They weren't great, but they were passable. This just pissed me off. I'm sure if this game came out 15 years ago, or for that matter 10 years ago, it'd be a great game and a classic at that.

While other characters are amusing in a small way (like Yamu) it doesn\\'t save this section from a poor score since most everyone is either gratuitously stupid or simply poorly developed.\\n\\nStory (score 2/10): Talk about non-existent.  What little story that exists is incredibly trite.  Kahu wants to become a beast hunter but then he gets cursed for touching a fairy cocoon.  Now he must collect 4 forest orbs to lift the curse.  There are several subplots along the way, but none of them are particularly interesting.  The story really suffers from the pace of it (slow) and the way it\\'s told.  The bits of story are revealed by talking to people in the dungeons.  Sometimes there is a scene (mostly monologues by the fairy Nico), but mostly it consists of simply exchanging a conversation.  There wouldn\\'t be anything wrong with this if it were paced better.  But the game drags on and on forever, with a lot of level grinding.  This really slows the story to a snail\\'s pace and makes you forget why you are even playing this game.  With all this you\\'d think the gameplay made up for it, right? Well, let\\'s see.\\n\\nBattle System (score 5/10): This part\\'s not so bad, but it does have its irritating bits.  Selecting attacks is turn-based, and battle involves having several monsters arranged on a wheel surrounding Kahu.  They can only carry one move for each element, and then can only use the move of the element that they are placed on in the wheel.  Furthermore, you can\\'t choose which enemy the monster attacks--it\\'s random.  Plus, monsters can only use their moves that take up MP; they only use normal attacks once their MP runs out.  That makes for a frustrating experience. Otherwise, I would\\'ve been fine with the battle system.\\n\\nGameplay (score 1/10): Repetitive is the word of the day.  There is only one \"town\" (and it\\'s dull).  Dungeons are long and boring, and each one looks just like the others, only a different color.  There was just no variety--and in a game that\\'s basically a dungeon-crawler, this is bad.  To make matters worse, the monster raising system is very unrewarding.  When you merge a monster, the appearance doesn\\'t even change (unlike the original Jade Cocoon).  Further, monsters stop leveling up at level 20, forcing you to merge them, which resets their levels to 1.  This really ruins any sense of accomplishment you had, because monsters revert to their weak-looking baby forms. It really sucks the fun out of the game.\\n\\nOverall (score 2/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it\\'s my subjective overall score.  Sigh, the first couple hours of this game are really fun-- before you get sick of it, that is. I wasn\\'t able to force myself to finish this game, and I don\\'t see why I should have to.  A game is supposed to be for fun, not something I should force myself to do.  I just don\\'t think I could recommend this game to anyone--except maybe the most diehard of dungeon-crawling fans.',\n",

              " \"This game was the reason I bought my Xbox One (to go with my PS4 that I've had since launch). It's now the reason I'm selling the console back. For some background, When I was 12-13 years old I played Halo: CE and here and there played Halo 2 with friends that owned the game. I spent maybe 15-20 hours on the original Halo games included in the MCC. Also, I did play the s*** out of Halo: Reach and it remains one of my favorite games to date. I had high expectations for the MCC because of Reach and have been severely disappointed.\\n\\nAs of 12/1/14:\\n\\n* Multiplayer is screwed up. I've been able to get into 4 matches. One was 5v2, one 2v0, one 1v0. The last was actually 8v8 and it was fun, but I don't think I'd be playing it much. The red vs blue gives a very old vibe that is fairly boring.\\n\\n* Graphics look good compared to the original games, but I expected a lot more. Compared to newer great looking games like Destiny, Assassins Creed (Black Flag... haven't tried Unity), and even The Last of Us, Halo graphics are kinda pathetic.\\n\\n* Texturing... ugh. I've never thought I cared much about texturing until I played this game. Halo MCC looks sparse and bland, especially CE and 2.\\n\\n* This might be a little controversial to some of you, but I do not care for the campaigns. Halo: Reach's story was absolutely amazing and I was totally engrossed in the probably 12 times I played through it. I feel almost bored going through CE, 2, 3, and 4 missions. Out of them all, I'm enjoying 2 and 3 the most.\\n\\n* Playing with friends can be a frustrating experience when connecting with one another. Some kinks need to be worked out where if the party leader leaves a mission (or a multiplayer lobby), the rest of the group should too. There are lots of little problems like that. Also, it takes a long time for the friends list to even load and sometimes friends that I'm chatting with in a party (and are in game) do not appear on the list.\\n\\n* I am not happy with the control setups available to me. I've been playing a good bit of Destiny and BF4, and going to Halo controls has been an annoying experience. I'd very much like to be able to assign my own controls how I like them if popular layouts aren't offered.\\n\\n* Actual gunplay is frustrating. I like having a very precise reticle so I know exactly what I'm shooting at (mostly for headshots) and the reticles in Halo MCC aren't fulfilling. Other games, I usually kill with headshots 70% of the time in multiplayer and 80-90% in single player/coop. In Halo, single player/coop is probably around 20%.\\n\\nI'm usually a skeptic so spending $60 on all this amazing content that was being advertised was pretty out-of-character and it should have been a red flag. I'll not make that mistake again. I will say that if you are a big fan of Halo, you'll probably eat this game up and love it. But for those of you who don't have an attachment to previous Halo games and are looking for current-gen quality, don't get your hopes up.

Rome Total War was one of the best of the franchise, only superseded by Medieval II Total War, which was essentially the exact same game, but with more features and better graphics.\\n\\nThe best I can say for Rome 2 is that it\\'s better than Empire Total War and Napoleon Total War, though that\\'s not really saying much.\\n\\nAs well, it took this game for me to realize that, aside from Medieval II, Total War Shogun 2 was the best of the \"modern\" Total War games, with a truly engaging campaign map that was short and well-defined (25 years or so over 200 turns in the main game, 10 years over 200 turns in Fall of the Samurai) giving you plenty of time to work with your family members and agents and overall policy for your clan.  Battles were actually discernible and fun to watch, particularly as each individual unit seemed to be able to lock on to an enemy or two, with some groups getting into mini-duels with a single opponent, often to have one of their comrades step in and abruptly end it with a quick stab to the other duelist.  There was enough of an RPG element and a balance in AI (to some degree) so that you could predict which clans would behave stupidly, and which would maintain strong alliances.\\n\\nRome 2 doesn\\'t deviate too far from this setup, and is much more like Shogun 2 than the original Rome Total War.  But something about it just doesn\\'t work.\\n\\nFor one, there\\'s the passage of time.  Shogun 2 worked because there was plenty of time to do stuff in a year\\'s time in-game, so you could decide the fate of your clan within a period of just a year or two, or even draw out a war of attrition into something that could span a decade.  In Rome 2, each turn has 1 year pass.  Combining this with the incredibly slow movement of units on the campaign map, and you have a situation less like the first game and more similar to Medieval II\\'s campaign map, where a journey which should take months ends up taking almost a decade or more.\\n\\nMedieval II was trying to cram 500 years of Medieval history into a 200 turn game, and compensated by having the game mechanics operate on a 2 turns per year system (much like RTW).  This means that characters and agents aged at a rate of 6 months per turn, which could make it ridiculous to have a King reign for 200 years and only be 80 or so.  But in Rome 2, characters age with the turns, so the vast majority of your generals, admirals, named characters, and agents, will be well into their middle ages by the time they\\'re accomplished generals, even if they are fighting in frequent wars.\\n\\nNothing in the game allows for this 1 turn per year to be even remotely realistic, and given that such an emphasis is now placed on generals (ie, you NEED a general or an admiral in order to lead armies) you may as well not even bother polishing and grooming them into being your game\\'s Caesar or Alexander or Alcibiades, because they\\'ll die of old age by the time they\\'ve got a full army and plenty of battle experience.\\n\\nThis effect was somewhat similar in Rome Total War (2turns per year), yet there you had the versatility of a Family Tree---it wouldn\\'t be wise to focus on a single character, but you could polish and groom him and his children, and establish a veritable dynasty of men that you craft to be master generals or master administrators or master politicians, even going so far as to pass down ancillaries (like tutors, mentors, pet dogs, family heirlooms, custom armor, sacred artifacts) from generation to generation, and feel a genuine sense of loss if that family member dies without passing on the ancillaries.\\n\\nIn Rome 2, there\\'s absolutely none of that.  No family tree, no valuable ancillaries you could risk losing, nothing particularly special other than the exact same trees of traits you can pick for characters that contribute virtually nothing to the character.  Whereas in Rome Total War, a character could have a foul temper, and have it affect his influence, or a mental illness which affects his troops\\' morale, in Rome 2, there\\'s only room for 3 traits that come entirely at random, followed by skills that add to things like \"zeal\", \"authority\", and  which contribute little to nothing to the character at all, particularly since they die of old age so quickly.\\n\\nThe campaigns themselves are another disastrous mess...\\n\\nOne of my worries about modding the game (particularly to increase the number of turns per year) was the risk of too-fast growth and expansion.  For example, Medieval II Total War was designed to be 2 years per turn, and so the growth of cities reflects the sort of gradual growth that would span centuries, even if named characters live much longer than humanly possible.  No matter how fast you grew or conquered, you were unlikely to trigger such events as the discovery of Gunpowder or the recruiting of Plate-armored Knights by the 1100s, whereas if you decreased the years in each turn, you could see your nation conquer half of Europe with musketmen and cannons, and an expedition heading to America by 1200 AD.\\n\\nEven in Rome Total War, whereas in real history, Rome expanded in fits and spurts, rapidly expanding during certain war periods, and remaining steady and consolidating their gains over decades, so that the breakdown of the Republic occurred by the 80s BC, in-game, you could easily consolidate your gains, and spark an End-Game situation as early as the 190s BC, and see Rome dominating everything west of Greece by 140s BC, facing off against the Seleucids or Egypt or Parthia dominating everything east of Greece.\\n\\nDespite this, it appears my fears are somewhat unfounded in this game, not just due to the poor pacing and slow movement of everything, but due to two factors; AI passivity and the horrendous new Province/Settlement system.\\n\\nThe game AI is no better or worse than average for Total War, except that in the campaign map, everyone seems so idle and passive.  More than 100 turns into the game, no one has ever declared war on me out of the blue, and of the dozen or so factions that have been wiped out, more than half of them were wiped out by me and my expansion.  I feel that I could easily set this to last 500 turns, 4 turns per year, and little would change over the scope of the campaign without my interference.\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t bother me -too- much, but this is a Total War game, not a Civilization game.  This is a problem of trying to fit so much history into a single campaign.  I feel that Medieval Total War did it best, by having three separate campaigns divided by era----early, high, and late.  Even Shogun 2 did it, albeit with DLC and expansion packs, between Rise of the Samurai in the 1170s AD, Sengoku Jidai in 1575-1600, and Fall of the Samurai in 1867-1877 AD.\\n\\nI feel like if the game had divided into three different eras of Roman history, they could have contained as much as they wanted to in scope, while making the game much more of an aggressive \"Total War\" type game.\\n\\nAs for the Settlement/Province system...\\n\\nRome and Medieval II Total War let you build any type of building in any type of settlement, restricted only by population growth and city expansion---you couldn\\'t build huge barracks and mansions in a village of 400 people, but if it grew to 25,000 you could.\\n\\nBy Empire and Napoleon Total War, settlements were reduced to a pre-determined size, with only 5-6 building slots, requiring you to diversify your regions, so one settlement would specialize in infantry, another in cavalry, another in artillery, another in farming, etcetera.  This continued into Shogun 2, with the added bonus of bringing back city expansion, opening up more slots for you to add to your settlements.\\n\\nRome 2 has the same thing, but has reduced it down to a sharp scale, to where most settlements will only be able to have 3 buildings, with other settlements able to expand to add another building slot with enough population growth, but there\\'s no clear reason as to why some settlements can grow, and others mysteriously can\\'t.\\n\\nThe map is divided into \"Provinces\" which consist of 2-5 individual settlements, all connected to one another based solely upon the arbitrary delineation of the game creators.  Whereas Athens and Sparta were so fundamentally different that they spoke different dialects of Greek almost unrecognizable to one another, they are lumped together into the province of Hellas for the sole convenience of distance, with the island of Crete added along because the game creators said so.\\n\\nWhat this means is that each settlement in the province is linked together.  Whereas in previous games, unhappiness and squalor varied depending on individual cities, as is basic common sense, now it is distributed amongst the settlements, so if one settlement is rich and luxurious, and its neighbor is a slum-ridden wasteland, people will riot in the rich and luxurious settlement, because the game creators said so.\\n\\nSpeaking of unhappiness and squalor...\\n\\nI really don\\'t even need to say much, but for the sake of a review, I will.  Perhaps the primary cause of the aforementioned timid and passive AI is the ridiculous heaps of squalor from improving virtually every building.\\n\\nMuch of this system seems to borrow heavily from Civilization 5, which as I mentioned in my review of it, actually PUNISHES and PENALIZES you for EXPANDING and GROWING your empire.  It rewards stagnation and not building anything more than necessary to live.\\n\\nSimilarly here, all the basic buildings enable basic services (Farms produce food, field camps produce militia troops, consecrated sites provide order bonuses and culture spread, ports provide basic ships and trade), but the more you upgrade them, the more they penalize you in terms of squalor or food.\\n\\nEVERY food building (farm, animal herds, fishing ports) will produce tremendous squalor as higher levels.  Squalor contributes DIRECTLY to unhappiness in this game, as opposed to being a percentage of unhappiness that would come together with all the other factors.\\n\\nEVERY building that isn\\'t food will consume large amounts of food to build, which in turn means you\\'ll need more food buildings, or else you\\'ll have starvation across provinces, which will lead to steep declines in happiness anyway.\\n\\nSo basically, you\\'re PENALIZED for naturally growing and expanding.  Not rushing through anything (you need to research higher and higher level technologies to unlock certain buildings), not cheating to add tons of gold to build the higher level buildings quickly, not doing anything to exploit the in-game system; you are PENALIZED for ACTUALLY PLAYING THE GAME.\\n\\nThis causes madcap situations like having your lush, well-fed, barely-taxed home region fall into anarchy and rebellion while a region you are freshly conquering is happy and joyous because you\\'ve just started building and you\\'ve got your full armies stationed there.\\n\\nPlaying as Athens, I had secured all of Greece and Macedonia, made the lunge into Sicily and Italy, and was pacifying northern Italy, wiping out Rome, when suddenly I get the word that Hellas (Athens, Sparta, Hierapytna) was miserable, and public order was plummeting by the double digits.  Squalor?  Massive.  Build up farming and markets?  More squalor.  Build up a fishing port, a trading port, or a naval port?  More squalor.  A barracks to train soldiers?  More squalor.  A brand new plumbing system to help clean up squalor?  LESS FOOD.  How the hell do stone aqueducts cost FOOD?  They\\'re made of STONE, not meat!\\n\\nAnd there\\'s no real explanation as to what actually affects public order in any real way.  Whereas in previous games, you could see each individual settlement information, see how religion/culture penalties stacked up with unhappiness over high taxes, stacked up with squalor and/or boredom or unrest over having an army occupy them, and understand why the settlement is in turmoil, and MOST OF ALL, know exactly what to do to alleviate it.\\n\\nFor example, you could check a settlement to see that squalor was contributing to 80% of the unhappiness, and the tax burden contributing to 30% (leading to a -10% public order rate), you would know to build buildings that dealt with squalor to attack the big problem first.\\n\\nIn Rome 2, you\\'re informed of the benefits and problems caused by taxes, culture, etcetera, even from high slave populations, but a whole other variable is left there as a general \"Who the Hell Knows\" in the form of \"Provincial Instability\"\\n\\nWhat causes it?  Who the hell knows.  In the aforementioned situation, Hellas was built up, and well-fed, with taxes at their absolute lowest settings.  Provincial Instability combined with the massive Squalor and plunged Hellas\\' public order down more and more every single turn, until it revolted and was quickly put down.  From there, Provincial Instability briefly disappeared.  Meanwhile, most of my armies were in Italy, and Italy was at full 100% public order, with NO provincial instability despite being recently conquered, and virtually identical to Hellas in terms of building diversity.\\n\\nAgain and again throughout the campaign, \"Provincial Instability\" strikes provinces entirely at random, with no explanation as to what is causing it.  I can be completely at peace, with three client states under me, and plenty of food coming in, very low taxes, and coffers bursting with tens of thousands of talents of gold, and suddenly a region will stop growing due to low public order and eventually revolt unless I send one of my armies to boost the Military Presence score.\\n\\nSpeaking of military, the new system seems to go straight to Marian-era private armies, where generals recruit soldiers directly.  You need them to be in a certain settlement with the right barracks or workshops to get the better quality units and weapons, but ultimately you can\\'t train a small task force to just hang around without appointing a general to it, and you can\\'t leave a full stack of versatile heavy infantry to defend a border town; garrisons are automatically deployed when attacked, and you need a general-led army in town to add to the defense.\\n\\nThe new Unit Cards are also horribly done.  In every previous game up until Shogun 2, they used mini screenshots of the actual video game unit, as it appears on the field.  In Shogun 2, they went for stylized drawings of the units, or stylized pictures resembling daguerreotype photographs for Fall of the Samurai.\\n\\nThe drawings here are so cheap and lazy, it\\'s almost impossible to tell the difference between certain units.  If it weren\\'t for the names popping up when you hover over them, you\\'d barely even be able to tell the difference between Hastati and Principes, Hoplites and Pikemen and Thorax Pikemen, Javelinmen and Slingers (?!), and so on.  At some point, you don\\'t even bother recognizing the units by name or armor/weapons, but by broad shapes in the UIs---you know this is a ballista because it looks like a bow, you know this is a cavalry trooper because it has a horse-looking thing in it, you know this is a higher-level legionary because the helmet is shaped differently.\\n\\nThe UI as well is an utter mess that hides valuable information in slide-up tabs that appear when you click on settlements or armies, and which hides the Event Log in a decision I cannot even imagine making any sort of sense at all.  You have to manually open the event log most of the time, only to find that it is unevenly spaced with the rest of the UI, causing it to take up a huge part of the screen.\\n\\nThen there\\'s agents.  Much like Shogun 2, they charge money to do their jobs that you hire them for to begin with, and by and large they\\'re mostly useless, meant either to assassinate one another or give minor bonuses to your own army.\\n\\nThe last major issue with the campaign is the factions system.  I\\'ve only played as Athens thus far, so I can\\'t speak for how well it works with divided nations like Rome and Carthage.  Much like Rome Total War, you play as families (properly named now, House of Julia, Junia, Cornelia) which end up controlling the entirety of Rome, so there aren\\'t multiple Roman factions on the map, which is good, I suppose, and better represents the coming civil war.\\n\\nBut what I don\\'t understand for Athens at least is the whole point of having factions which are apparently hostile to one another, and to which I am actively a member of one, along with controlling the entire nation of Athens.\\n\\nBasically, there are \"Oligarchs\" and \"Magistrates\".  I didn\\'t get to choose, I was automatically made a Magistrate.  I had to suffer the Oligarchs trying to assassinate my own generals and family members, sometimes succeeding, and my having absolutely no control over their actions, save to try to do the same to them.\\n\\nExcept, like I said before, I CONTROL ALL OF ATHENS.  Meaning I can appoint Oligarch faction members to the heads of armies.  Even armies only 100 men strong.  I can then send that tiny army straight into the Sahara desert and wait until they die of attrition, or the Numidians get sufficiently enraged by my trespassing that they attack and kill them.  Literally nothing stops me from doing this because there is no repercussion, no benefit, no sense that this factionalism is even affecting my campaign at all beyond aggravating me by having experienced generals suddenly drop dead or get put out of action for 5 years, wounded from a botched assassination attempt.\\n\\nNow, to the battles.\\n\\nIn true \"vanilla\" Total War style, they are fast, wild, and typically over quickly.  Completely out of the norm for Total War style, units now don\\'t even bother to stay in formation when fighting, opting instead to go Hollywood-style one-man-army Drunken Titus Pullo Breaking Rank And Forcing Lucius Vorenus To Have Him Whipped For Disobeying And Assaulting Him.  The worst part is, the Hoplites actually have a Phalanx formation, and can move in phalanx formation.  Though if I order them to run, they will immediately break Phalanx formation.  So I try to keep them walking.  They STILL break phalanx formation as soon as they reach the enemy line.\\n\\nI\\'ve already seen the term \"Blob\" used to describe these battles in Rome 2, where units simply pile on to each other, with seeming disregard for physics, into massive balls.  I haven\\'t seen it happen frequently, though that may just be because enemy units tend to rout quickly, long before I can pile in enough troops to make a blob.\\n\\nLiterally no previous Total War game from Rome to Shogun 2 has been this bad in terms of unit spacing and formation.  In all those games, units maintained formation as much as their discipline and training allowed, and if soldiers were standing side by side, filling a small area with their bodies, you could not cram in MORE soldiers to stand next to them like you can in this game.\\n\\nWinding down with one of the major complaints, graphics.  It looks pretty, though the decision on coloring seems to be odd, depending largely on lighting.  Compared to Shogun 2, soldiers are in bright, bold colors, sometimes incongruent, looking like a line of ketchup and mustard bottles for a Roman line.\\n\\nAs well, the campaign map is massive, and apparently more detailed than Shogun 2.  I only assume so because, while Shogun 2\\'s campaign map runs smoothly on my high-powered computer all the time, Rome 2\\'s campaign map is constantly refreshing textures when I move the map around.  I can center in on Greece, move over to Italy, have Italy\\'s textures appear flat and pixelated and quickly rebuff to their high quality settings, then scroll back to Greece and have its textures appear flat and pixelated as well, before rebuffing to high quality.  Aside from this, everything runs smoothly and quickly.\\n\\nExcept for loading times.\\n\\nEven basic, small-scale battles take twice as long to load up as battles did in Shogun 2, despite there being no noticeable difference in memory or graphical strain on my system, and the dreaded End Turn can take as long as 2 minutes, even early into the game.  It makes it impossible to become immersed in the campaign gameplay, as each turn wastes away, with bogged down End Turn times forcing you to either watch the computer units meander about aimlessly, or find something to distract you until it\\'s your turn again.\\n\\nAnother review of the game by Rowan Kaiser from ArsTechnica perfectly sums up this experience:\\n\\n\"In most grand strategy games, the motivation to play \"just one more turn\" is the most appealing part. In Total War: Rome II, \"just one more turn\" is a threat.\"\\n\\n****PATCH 4 UPDATE****\\n\\nI hadn\\'t touched the game since October 6th, but boredom overcame, and so I looked to finish my grueling Athenian campaign, currently post-turn 300 because the victory conditions are obscenely long, and by which standards even the Roman Empire wouldn\\'t reach (I currently control about as much land, if not more than Rome at its height, which consists of some 120 settlements, when I need 140 for victory.  Alternately, I need 90 settlements and 20 trade agreements for an economic victory, but GOOD LUCK GETTING 20 TRADE PARTNERS THIS LATE IN THE GAME).\\n\\nBasically, the only changes I\\'ve noticed are cosmetic.  The biggest change from Patch 1 was that the End Turn time was sharply reduced, and loading times between battles or loading saves is similarly reduced.  Some icons were fixed, or expanded upon to provide better information, and naval units now have symbols representing their upgraded hulls.\\n\\nDespite the reportedly hundreds of changes made, my earlier statement (and the title of my Civ5 review) still rings true for this game---shiny new expansions and patches can\\'t fix a rotten foundation.\\n\\n- If there were ANY improvements to AI, I haven\\'t seen them yet, or I may have to start up a whole new campaign, because the Campaign AI is essentially DOA---literally no faction declares war on me, the player, and they are ALWAYS begging for money in exchange for meaningless Non-Aggression Pacts (meaningless because they never declare war on me anyway), or trade agreements they break off turns later due to losing their trading port, or a general hissy fit.  Similarly, they seem completely, blissfully ignorant of your or any other AI\\'s movements.\\n\\nIt seemingly makes sense for the player character to not be able to see the entirety of the map right away (it would cause utter hell on End Turn times, as well), but a staple of the series has tended to be that AI would recognize when their borders were weak; it would build up armies or keep them close by to borders with other factions.  This is given even MORE opportunity in Rome 2 by allowing you to walk through other nations\\' lands without having to declare war or seek military access, though by doing so you anger the nation and risk provoking conflict.\\n\\nBut since the AI never declares war on you, you\\'re free to squat 6 armies on top of an enemy city and watch as they mewl and do nothing.  They don\\'t even bring up their own armies to try to passive-aggressively urge you to leave.  As such, if you\\'re planning to take over every settlement owned by a faction, you can freely move your armies into position to blitz them within 1 turn, and the AI won\\'t do a thing to stop you, or even pretend to be concerned.\\n\\nYet by the same (lack of) logic, the AI will break off trade agreements with you if they feel you\\'re getting too rich or too close to economic victory.\\n\\n- Battle AI.  I firmly believe that so long as those EFFing flags are there, the battle AI will remain fundamentally broken at the basest level.  In prior games, siege battles had a \"flag\" in the form of a town square, but the AI was seemingly more focused upon actually fighting out a battle---their main force would besiege, attack your defending forces, then if they had backup or reinforcements on the other side of the settlement, would slip in from the rear and take the town square WHILE KEEPING your forces occupied.\\n\\nInstead in this game, practically the exact opposite happens; the force deployed to attack your defense forces will SIT and WAIT for their \"secret reserves\" to slip in and snatch the town square, allowing you full momentum to bring virtually your entire army to smash that backup force, then sit and wait for 50 minutes as the enemy besiegers stand there and wait for the now-destroyed force to steal the victory for them.  Most of the time, they will send a few siege engines to at least try to attack your forces, but if the first wave fails, they don\\'t even bother trying again.  And this is a NEW PROBLEM---enemies would ALWAYS attack in siege battles for as long as they had siege equipment!  The battle would automatically end in victory for you if the enemy\\'s siege towers and/or battering rams were set on fire and destroyed; it even encouraged the AI to build more ladders, since they could never be destroyed.\\n\\nBut since only settlement capitals have walls now, the vast majority of siege battles are essentially village defenses like in prior games where your settlement didn\\'t even have a basic wooden palisade up.  Here, the enemy AI is entirely fixated on that EFFing flag.  Every single siege defense battle I have played, from day 1, to patch 4, has consisted of the enemy rushing ALL their troops forward against one of my lines, throwing ALL their infantry and cavalry into my units, IGNORING THEM, and trying to rush PAST them to get to my EFFing flag.  This has caused victories which saw my garrison forces of less than 1000 win heroic victories against enemy forces 4 and 5 times larger, simply because the enemy ran into my spears, and kept trying to run, rather than bothering to stop and fight.\\n\\nAll these factors coming together, combined with the release-day bugs, the reportedly 40% larger (than any prior TW game) budget, and the breath-taking arrogance from the marketing side, makes this whole game, even now more than a month after release and 4 patches adding up to hundreds of megabytes of more data, an unmitigated failure of game play design.',\n",

Feels like an older PS3 game.\\n* Even as a single player game, the actual game play is very boring and the story isn\\'t good so far. Many elements feel like Jax and Daxter from the PS2. And I love that game. But this is a poor imitation.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t expecting anything amazing. I simply wanted a decent 2 player platformer. As a 2 player game, it\\'s one of the worse I have played. As a single player game, it\\'s just no fun. Even my 7 and 9 year old kids are annoyed by this game. And I thought Disney\\'s Universe for the PS3 was bad. As flaw as that game is, it\\'s better than Knack.\\n\\nMy pain and frustration is made worse by the fact I paid full price for this on release day. Ouch.\\n\\nIGN gave it a 5.9 out of 10, and I think that is being generous. If you really feel you need this game, at least wait for the cost to drop... a lot!\\n\\nIf you have any questions for me about this game, make a comment. I normally check reviews before I buy a game. But I wanted something to play when I got the PS4 on launch day and coming from Sony and all the hype, I expected this to at least be decent to hold me off until I figured out some other games.\\n\\nRemember, I bought this game specifically for 2 player mode. And so I am giving it 1 star for that fail alone. For single player action, it\\'s a 2 or 3 star game so far. But certainly still far below my expectations from Sony with all the hype. And even at 3 stars tops from me, that isn\\'t good enough for a $60 new-release cost.\\n\\nUPDATE: I still can\\'t stand the co-op play on this game. I still feel it\\'s a 1 star if you want this game for 2 players. And it\\'s maybe a 3 out of 5 stars for single player. I finally had a chance to try the Android companion game for Knack and that is awful. Some people are still very polarized on this game. But many reviews agree with me. It\\'s not masterpiece it was hyped to be. Almost a year since it\\'s release and the price is still too high. I would really wait for this to drop below $20 before trying it out. If you are still interested.\\n\\nMany people have said this review is not helpful. I am curious as to why. The only thing I can think of, is that is their way of disagreeing with my opinion. Comments are a better place for that. As my title says, this review is based heavily on the Co-op aspect of the game.',\n",

Sony has been on the decline with their games and their systems lately.  I have not played my PS3 much anymore due to the lack of games.

Thank God I bought an XBOX in 2011 and I have been much more satisfied with XBOX Live and the games.

I guess you just roll the dice, play the game as quick as you can to reach the end and hope you can go back later to play.  At this time, I will not replace my PS3 and I have no plans to get the new console from Sony after they announce and release it.

I was very disappointed to disover that BioShock installed SecuROM on my PC, if you have an Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 buy it for one of those... but not PC.\\nBioShock is a deep and rich game that will keep you immersed in its strange underwater fantasy world for hours at a time.

              " \"I played this game for close to 200 hours in a failed attempt to get some fun out of it.  Yes, you're going to think that I got 200 hours of enjoyment out of it, but no I didn't.  I kept reading that if I get to X section or X level or X difficulty or X gear that the game comes alive.  700 days played in World of Warcraft.  Thousands of hours played in D2.  Having played many Blizzard games I kept giving this trash the benefit of the doubt but finally realized it was nothing but Blizzard fan boys talking and quit.\\n\\nI believed in Blizzard Entertainment.  I really, really did.  From the start the game is doomed as the story has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese.  Then you're expected to play the game in a group where one guy always clicks skip story.  Playing solo is futile as your gear drops will be for another class, thus you need different classes in your group to share the loot.  Sounds pretty stupid right?  It is trust me.  What if the other guy in the group doesn't want to share?  You get nothing.  Fun huh?  So at this point you're stuck buying gear off the auction house for either millions of gold or real money.  This game is all about the fun of looking on the auction house for gear to beat a level.  Pure fail Blizzard!  Pure fail!\\n\\nThen there are issues with the game's difficulty as it makes you play the game out on beyond easy mode where I lost 3 friends to boredom.  They refused to finish the first difficulty as they literally danced in the fire, intentionally got hit, and never died.  They said the game was crap and quit.  The game doesn't get decent until the 3rd time you've played it through.  So you have to play the exact same game 3 times before you get a challenge unless you fall asleep at the keyboard from boredom and die.  If you get to a section you can't get past just buy some gear off the auction house and more than likely you're back to god mode again.\\n\\nLast point I want to touch on is that the game's end game is nonexistent.  As in it's hard not because it's fun, but because it cheeses you into death.  I play a Demon Hunter and most everything can one shot you unless you invested hundreds of million in gold into your gear.  Then you can last for 3 hits!  So assume you're not the type of person to spend real money on the auction house.  So you're going to get a ton of one hit deaths when you try to kill elite mobs.  You might die 9 times to a mob if you're not spending real money on gear.  Repair bill will be close to 50,000 gold.  The mob will drop about 3,000 gold in items and money.  So then you get in a group and pray that the mob decides to chase another person.  But there are tons more of them so you still die over and over.  Sounds like fun huh?  Who thought mechanics that can one shot kill you were fun?\\n\\nI also want to mention that the game lags like no other.  Take the one shot mechanics from the aforementioned paragraph and sprinkle in some huge lag spikes and you can watch your characters die over and over to invisible mobs, invisible attacks, melee mobs hitting you clean across your screen, etc.  And there is a Hardcore mode where if you die you lose your character and all of it's gear.  That makes the game even more fun with lag!\\n\\nGame is terrible.  Leave it in the store.  Do not buy.  It is not fun in the slightest when you get to Inferno.  The story is terrible.  The gear drops don't exist for you.  The auction house is the best place to level up.  And the real money auction house has the best gear.\\n\\nEnough said.  :)\",\n",

What started off as a nice, refreshing experience that pays homage to one of my favorite game series of all time quickly turns into a boring game with copious amounts of backtracking and little to no content aside from the main story. This isn't a Star Ocean game, it is the hollowed out corpse of a Star Ocean game.\\n\\nThe story isn't nearly as bad as other people have made it out to be. However, there is also little depth to the story. Without getting into spoilers, let's just say that you don't really care about the characters. Some of the private moments make no sense because there is no backstory to give it context.\\n\\nThe battle system is fine. One of the only good parts of the game.\\n\\nThe bulletin board quests are a joke. You can only do the same fetch X item quests so many times before it becomes monotonous.\\n\\nThe cities and towns are nice but there is nothing in them. The cities of star ocean 2 were half the size (or smaller in some cases) and yet there were tons more homes to enter, chests to gather, people to speak to. There is none of that in this game. The world map is no different. there are so few areas that they are forced to make new chests appear after certain points in the game in order for there to be some reason to explore.\\n\\nThere is no side content. Aside from the bulletin board quests, there really isn't much to do. The game just feels boring. Maybe that is why they don't allow you to save at certain points of the game. That way you will die, have to back track 20 minutes worth of stuff just to get back to where you were (the battle with Der-Suul).\\n\\nOne of my favorite parts of Star Ocean games is private actions and getting secret/optional characters. To this point, aside from endings, I couldn't find a single reason to continue to do PA's. I also hate the fact that there are NO secret/optional characters.\\n\\nI don't really have an issues that there are some monsters from previous games as well as some music. To me, I enjoy that stuff. It doesn't feel cheap or like a short cut, it is nostalgic. I loved hearing some of the SO3 music from Kirlsa & Aquaria in this game. What I do have a problem with is that the only thing elements do is remind me of the former glory that Star Ocean had as a video game. Even with the short story and very linear game, it would have been fine with a great deal of post-game content. Although I am close to finishing the game, according to everything I have read, there isn't much to do.\\n\\nPick it up for $30 or something later on.\\n\\nUpdate ---\\n\\nI am now about 7 hours into the game. Still liking the game but I am adding some more Pro's and Con's and dropping the rating to 4 stars.\\n\\nPro's:\\nI like how they used some music from SO3 and incorporated it into this game. I also like the cathedral challenge thing. Pretty neat concept. I do like that there are a lot of enemies from other star ocean games and that the enemies change as you progress through the game. Story is good to this point (not great but good). I like the idea of harvesting/mining/fishing.\\n\\nCon's: They have these big, beautiful cities and yet there is nothing to do in them. Private actions are minimal. In previous Star Ocean games you could enter almost every house in a given town/city to explore. The amount of treasure chests are minimal. I hate how battle skills aren't learned by levels but rather from miss able items.\\n\\nSo far it is still a good game and I would still recommend it to any Star Ocean fans. But I can't help but feel like they missed an opportunity to add more depth to this game. Also, as some people haven't been aware of this, if you are having camera issues you can zoom in and out using the d-pad.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nAbout 3 1/2 hours in and so far... I would give it 4.5 stars. Definitely feels like a Star Ocean game (which is great). It has many of the elements of a traditional JRPG. I loved Star Ocean 1, 2 and 3 but was not a fan of 4. The odd boss battles of 4 really turned me off (thankfully the boss battles in this game are more reminiscent of precious Star Ocean titles). As someone that has beaten Star Ocean 2 & 3 at least 5 times each, I am a big fan and 4 was just unplayable. I tried 4 different times to get into that game and I just couldn't. This game had me hooked almost instantly.\\n\\nI really can't say much more other than I love the fact that the person that did the voice for Rena in the Star Ocean 2 PSP port also does the voice for a character in this game. So far the Item creation system seems good but I haven't progressed far enough to really test how complex and in depth it is.\\n\\nI will continue to update this review as I get further. The one thing I am not a fan of is the in town environment. It isn't a huge deal but talking to NPCs can sometimes feel a bit awkward and clunky. Haven't had any issues with the camera as other people have but I can see why it would irritate some people.\\n\\nIgnore the 1 star reviews that knock the story. Although I can't say for certain how it is, any 1 star review knocking the story can't be real as the game was just released today. How can you have seen any major plot twists or surprises when you haven't finished the game?\",\n",

              " \"Let me get straight to the point.  This game blows and is in my estimation, an early candidate for worst game of the year.  The history of Harry Potter hasn't always been a good one.  They have ranged from fair to acceptable, but have never really reached the heights of imagination from the rich source material that they came from.  However, you could not deny that they were each good, solid efforts with the next iteration improving from the one before it.  Then comes Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1.  Gone are the free roaming explorations of Hogwarts.  This time Harry and friends are on the run.  And with this one bold plot course in the book, goes any semblence of a decent Harry Potter game.  What developer EA Bright Light did so well in the previous game in terms of sandbox gaming is now replaced by a clunky third person shooter.  This gameplay change could have been a welcomed divergence to the previous games if only were the mechanics not so broken.\\n\\nYou start off playing as Harry with one main spell that eventually swells to half a dozen or so while progressing through the game.  I'm okay with the variety, yet I never found myself using anything other than the stupify spell which seemed more effective against enemies.  There is a cover mechanic yet good luck finding a barrier to hide behind that will stick and keep you from getting hit with spell projectiles.  The lock on mechanic is slippery and you'll often find yourself casting spells at empty air when it was focused on an enemy a second ago. Even more odd is that in some parts of the game, the view will shift from a third person perspective to a first person perspective without any rhyme or reason other than the developers trying to shake up the dull gameplay.  There was one instance in the game that literally had me tearing my hair out.  Harry is hidden under his invisibility cloak and must sneak around to accomplish a mission without being discovered.  Once the mission is over, Harry must then sneak back to the original point in which he started in order to trigger a cut scene.  The difficulty level then spikes and all of a sudden you're being discovered without anyone near you.  I must have tried this level a dozen or so times before I finally got past it, yet I have no idea if it was due to my skill or just chance.\\n\\nThe graphics are equally bad.  Though Harry, Hermione and Ron look detailed enough, they inhabit a world of muddy textures and dull environments.  The cut scenes seemed rushed and unfinished and failed to stitch together any semblence of a coherent plot.  Harry is given a mission to find the remaining Horcruxes, yet he then must partake in side missions that involve him sneaking out of a dragon's lair (don't ask how he got there), rescuing muggles and freeing captured wizards.  Weird.\\n\\nI never expected a great Harry Potter game, but I could always expect a competent one that offered me a couple hours of fun as a fan of the series.  Deathly Hallows completely flipped the formula and instead offered a game so ugly and crippled by its gameplay mechanics that it's a shame that the best book in the series could not serve as inspiration for a good game.  There is a couple of months for the developer to correct their mistakes before the second part of this game is released in July of 2011 but I'm not holding my breath.\",\n",

You better get rid of NCAA FOOTBALL 13 before you will not get any money back for it, especially if you paid $65. I paid $44.99 for that copy and I lost about $15 on it.\\n\\nEA is also making madden 13 and I will not buy this game until I see it even if there are great reviews and rating. If it is not better than madden 10, I will not buy it even though I love playing football.

It's basically Fable one on the Fable two/three engine.\\nThis is actually worse than the Halo one remake, which I didn't think was possible. The problem that was there was absolutely no multiplayer, it just included few downloadable maps for Halo:Reach. Anyway, same issue with this game, but graphics-wise. On the back of the box they said they just re-made the lighting... no they re-made the entire game.\\n\\nAll of the the unique art effects for the fire, the lightning, and even the 'force push' are gone, replaced by generic effects. The character you play as is hideous now, although to be fair most others do look well with their updates. The other one star review was right about the lag, it seems this game is always choppy and still loading even after it is finished, but I haven't had it freeze on me yet. There are bugs like followers not following you through loading screens also.\\n\\nI am a huge Fable fan so i'll try to enjoy it as much as I can but... it's bad. It's always nice to see the Unreal engine at work, but this is a sloppy remake instead of a port, which it should have been because Fable one has always had very good graphics, it didn't need any updates, just achievements.\\n\\nI will say again that you probably will enjoy this if you're a casual player, haven't played the original, or just don't remember it that well.

The combat is clunky and cumbersome. Also, you are limited to carrying 24 rounds of ammo for your gun for no reason whatsoever! I angrily left behind ammo because I had too much. This forces you to do melee combat or run. With the crappy camera angles, especially in hallways, that translates to running. Thats not fun.\\n\\n3. The enemies were poorly made.

It's literally almost impossible to kill the host. especially at close quarters inside buildings.  The host can run around the buildings in the center of every map and clean up against anyone.\\n\\nIt's akin to being a new/bad player going up against pros, except every single game match is like that.\\n\\nWhat's less fun than dying over and over again?  Getting kills you don't earn.  The horrible spawn system will at times spawn you directly behind an enemy player or the enemy team for an easy kill that is painfully unsatisfying.  I get no excitement for cheap shotting an enemy player who doesn't have a chance to win.\\n\\nOther times, the game will spawn an entire team right in front of you, and you'll get wasted instantly.\\n\\nThe host is literally a second ahead of all the other players.  He'll see you and kill you by the time you see him.  It makes close quarters combat miserable.  You'll go around the corner or he'll come around the corner and wham, you're dead.  Watching the kill cam confirms that he put enough bullets into you to kill you, but you never shot him once.\\n\\nThe only counter to the host, is the shotguns, but they're noob weapons with extremely huge spread in the crosshairs, and like spawning behind somebody, it's totally unsatisfying.  I hate killing other players with shotguns, and you will too.\\n\\nThe flaws are so miserable, that I can hardly believe they released the game in this condition.\\n\\nother 'features' this game has are unlimited sprint and unlimited wallrunning, both of which are invitations to die.  Either option gives you momentum which prevents you from changing direction, which means that you're an extremely easy target for the enemy.  I can't tell you how many times I've killed a sprinting or wallrunning player without even trying.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, you have to blow points on perks to ready your weapon faster, which is the only way to make sprinting a feasible option.\\n\\nSo, basically, all players do is camp.  It's the only viable strategy.\\n\\nThe game is played like this :  There are hardpoints on every map from which to camp from :  a wall, a concrete barricade, a window, basically anything you can camp behind and shoot from without exposing much of your own body to make you an easy target.  In between Hard points is no mans land, being out in the open with no cover, thus exposing your entire body to the enemy.\\n\\nBeing caught in no mans land by enemy players is death.\\n\\nThe only way to advance in the game, is by sprinting from hard point to hard point, spending as little time as possible in no mans land.\\n\\nI feel like every time I catch an enemy player in no mans land, I get a kill I don't deserve.  I usually never take any damage from these players.  It's almost like executing an unarmed prisoner with a firing squad... there's not a chance in hell they'll survive.  So where's the fun?\\n\\nThere is fun in fair firefights where 2 players both find themselves in no mans land having a firefight.  Or when 2 players find themselves both in cover at hard points, having a firefight from hard point to hard point.\\n\\nBut sadly, these encounters are a rarity.  Most players are not willing to take the risk of entering no mans lands, and for good reason : it's almost impossible to survive.\\n\\nBy camping at a hard point, even if you have a 4 players spawn in front of you, you still have the chance of picking an enemy off before his buddies can flank or rush your position.\\n\\nBut, if you're caught in no mans land against 4 players, you're instantly dead.\\n\\nI understand why the game suffers from so much lag and host advantage.  They're using peer to peer hosting rather than dedicate servers.\\n\\nBut I do not understand why the spawn system is so awful, and why you must burn so many perks on having any ability to run and gun.\\n\\nIt's just bad, broken game design.  I get no fun out of being killed from behind by a player who spawned directly behind me, and I get even less fun out of killing someone else from behind.\\n\\nI get no fun out of having an entire team spawn right in front of me and getting wiped out instantly.\\n\\nI get no fun out of wasting all my perks and points trying to make run and gun viable, when it never really will be and is a total waste of time.\\n\\nPlayers who design their class around camping hard points have a huge advantage over players who design their class for run and gun in no mans land.  Players who don't want to camp are punished severely for even trying to attack.\\n\\n*Some hard points with high ground are grenade and rocket catches.  These 'catch points' are more effective than others, but it's countered by the 'catch' design which makes it easy for someone to throw a grenade or shoot a rocket at you.  It's a nice little risk reward system.  I've gotten a lot of kills from them, and a lot of deaths from them.  It's smart map design.\\n\\n**  The best feature in the game are special abilities for your choice of special soldiers.  It's unlocked by earning points that aren't lost when you die.  It's basically the support killstreaks from MW3, except it's always active and you don't have to sacrifice your ability to earn kill streaks to use it.  It's the smartest idea Treyarch has ever had, and it adds an extra layer to excitement as the game match progresses.  Unfortunately, some of these special weapons take less or no skill to use, which can be frustrating when you die without any chance of winning.  I don't think the special abilties were balanced well.  The more noob abilties should take more time and points to unlock, to compensate for their 'noobness'.  I feel like they never even play tested these abilities, like the mine layer abilty, or the gravity spikes.  You don't even have to aim these abilties.\\n\\nI love the new jet pack.  It's fun and extremely responsive.  It controls perfectly and is always fun to use.  It's by far the best implementation of a jet pack (or jumping for that matter) ever in videogames.  A pure pleasure.\\n\\nWall running is also intuitive and fun.\\n\\nthe guns feel good to aim around.\\n\\nThe great controls add an extra layer of excitement to the game.\\n\\nSprinting causes the screen to jerk minimally, which makes you feel more like a machine.  can't decide if I like or dislike this, but it certainly sets the game apart from other call of dutys.\\n\\nIt all feels really polished.\\n\\nSometimes your character will not grab a ledge, causing you to fall to your death.\\n\\nShooters are all about gun porn, and Black Ops 3 has some of the best weapon renders ever.\\n\\nAnd the gun designs are all new.  There's no M4, M16, AK47, USP, M9, UMP, MP5..... none of that.  They're all new designs.  What a pleasant surprise.  I realize that usually when these guns make an appearance in call of duty, they always get reskinned and usually get reshaped, but you can usually still tell exactly what gun they are.  Designing completely new weapons is a big risk because it severs the link between fiction and reality.  Most shooters have a lot of real world weapons to ground the game in reality.  BO3 takes a big risk to go all out.  So it's great that theyve done this.  You can still see the precursor to many weapons.  The weavil was inspired by the Rcp90, a gun which I hate.  But i like the way the weevil looks.  So it's like, they put all this effort into fixing up old guns to look not only different, but way better.  The ARK7 is a futuristic AK47, and so on.\\n\\nThe graphics are great.  Beautiful textures and shaders.  5/5 for visuals.  It's a massive improvement over their previous games and takes full advantage of next gen hardware.  It's got the best looking hi res assets you will ever see.\\nI also love the weapon reload and death animations.\\n\\nI also love the player's arms and hands.  Getting this right is essential to any first person shooter, and it looks fantastic.  The best renders you have ever seen in any FPS.\\n\\nI didn't realize Treyarch was capable of these visuals.  It's the kind of massive leap forward that makes you wonder who developed it.\\n\\nI'm not sure how to describe black ops 3's graphics compared to their earlier games COD3, World at War, Black Ops, and Black Ops 2.  When I say it's their best looking game ever, I mean that at the time these games came out, they were not impressive as this game is now.\\n\\nIt's a mind blowing leap forward for Treyarch, and it runs at 60 framers per second.\\n\\nIt makes me wonder if it's the best looking game ever made.  Maybe MGS5 has better face renders, but you only see those close up in cutscenes, so it's not really a fair comparison.\\n\\nI can't really decide if it's the best looking game ever...  I don't feel comfortable saying it is or isn't, but it must be good to generate that kind of confusion.\\n\\nSuffice to say that Black Ops 3 is as good as games can look.\\n\\nI can talk about how great the graphics are all day, but it doesn't matter if the game is unplayable.  And the multiplayer is unplayable.\\n\\nIt's Sad that all Treyarch's hard work as gone to waste, but it's also true.\\n\\nFor me, the whole point of multiplayer is to test your skill against other living players.  That's what I find fun about it.  Strategy comes in a distant second.  You will find both lacking here.\\n\\nThere's fun to be had here in the well designed maps, but the Lag, Host advantage, Net Code and Spawn points make you suffer to get to it.\\n\\nEvery once in a while, you'll run into another player while you're both in no mans land, and have a sick shootout putting both your skills to the test...\\n\\nAnd then the host comes around the corner and kills you instantly.\",\n",

I am not one of those lucky people who may have received a functioning 1080p unit.

              " \"The name of this controller is deceiving, while it sounds and it cool with the two Z buttons, as soon as I played with it I hated it. This is one of the worst generic controllers on the market by far, I remember I purchased this controller the first time in black and the second time in purple and I only bought it because it was cheaper than the original Wavebird by Nintendo. When I bought it in black it was $10 and in purple for $20 nether online I bought both in store. So I essentially screwed myself buying both since the black was from a local gaming store/arcade who I knew the owner from church, the other one was a store I went to before the other owner opened the arcade. So all together it was a $30 screw up on my own part.\\n\\nBut as soon as I got my hands on this controller and played games with it within 5 minutes of playing my hands started to hurt. Not only did my hands hurt in some cases my characters controlled themselves. I remember while I played with this controller there was a section in the Gamecube precautions booklet that I read that it was recommended to buy nintendo products with the official Nintendo Seal on products to get full compatibility and the full experience. Well, anyway the store I bought it from sold used video games, accesories and other related items, and the owner told me he had one controller left. So at first I was excited because (little did I know) I wrongfully assumed at the time it was a Nintendo Brand and instead it was this pelican brand which is obviously a 3rd party generic manufacturer. So since the store I bought this from known as Stained Glass Eye a local store in which is in walking distance of where I live, which didn't allow for returns and refunds though it did allow you to get store credit for items you brought in, which was pointless to me anyway. I sold it to a another local game store who did allow refunds and returns and would give cash or store credit.  I\\n\\nOtherwise I do not recommend this controller for anyone who only prefers to buy first party brands and has the kind of money to buy first party brands accessories and items. I only recommend this controller to anyone who can't afford the First party brand (such as Nintendo).\\n\\nI do have one piece of advise to those who would rather buy generic and pay a cheaper price make sure you be careful with your hands while you are playing your video games as this will cause hand injuries, unless you have a special pair of gloves to protect your hands. Otherwise just be careful and be attentive and stop playing if your hand(s) starts to hurt or if you don't like the generic controller, save the extra money to buy the first party brand believe me its worth it but it is not worth it to buy this Generic Pelican brand!\\n\\nI did however when I took both controllers to the arcade I noticed the store had a Nintendo Wavebird which I bought and gave the store the two generic controllers and only paid $13 for it, so I did make my money back and repaid myself for my mistake. This controller is a financial and gaming mistake for any die hard Nintendo fan, who loves the First party brands.\",\n",

(as exaggerated as the honker the graphics dept. gave to Qui-Gon Jinn -- yes, the bridge on Liam Neeson's nose may be somewhat big, but since when did he have Karl Malden's nose?)\\nThe game is unfortunately lacking in the graphics department -- sometimes you can't see features on faces.\\nBut onto the ending. The game is fun, with a handful of challenging levels -- mostly due to the swarms of droids that come your way and droids taking stance behind high-powered laser cannons.\\nBut it's marred by a disappointingly quick and all-too-easy ending. The moment arrives -- you finally meet Darth Maul. Just like in the movie, you stand behind the laser wall and watch as Qui-Gon is struck down by Maul.\\nAnd finally the wall opens, you hold your breath, ready for a tough battle -- one that you may have to play repeatedly until you put together the right string of moves and blocks to take him out before your health runs out. But it's not to be.\\nDarth Maul is ridiculously easy to defeat. I beat him on my first try and in less than a minute. And you have to fight him twice -- as once you take him down the first time, he gets a new, full meter of health. So in less than a minute, I drew down two full health meters. I felt cheated, to say the least.\\nI remember fighting against Mace Windu to have to reach the next level, and I had to go toe to toe against him some 20 to 30 times before I finally beat him. I was expecting at least a battle on that level of difficulty, but it ended up being the easiest level of the whole game. All I had to do was slash at him and use some force saber twirls and Maul was done.\\nHow in the world could the game's makers create such a lackluster, lifeless, no-threat ending battle? I was left extremely wanting, and if it were a movie, I would have angrily asked for my money back. I cannot say enough how disappointing the ending was. Even more now, the Darth Maul character cries out for a game of his own. One can only wish -- for this Maul must have been a clone or imposter to go down with nary a fight.\",\n",

But two player mode doesn't add a second character--it just lets another person shoot at the screen!

The vehicle comes with what character you chose. So if you pick to play Tails, you automatically get an airplane and that's it.  To me that was a huge downside and sort of the deal breaker.

Not only that, but the big plot points and emotional scenes in this game will have little to no impact if you haven't at least played ME2, so there is really no point playing this game by itself.

Sure, you might enjoy it, but you're missing out on a HUGE portion of the game's appeal.\\n\\nIn the end, though, this game and this series as a whole was just a big waste of time for me. After devoting countless hours to the Mass Effect series (games, books, developer diaries, etc), being completely enveloped in the game's world and elaborate history, and giving this series more love than any other work of fiction I have ever come across, I've completely written off this game series and the developer (Bioware). The ending completely kills everything that makes the game's story and world believable. For me, it was just so embarrassingly stupid and crazier than anything I could have ever possibly imagined.

Not needed, and annoying. The same could be accomplished simply by having that character narrate. 2. There are \"choices\" in the game which allow two different outcomes. Most are - one choice is very dumb. Then they show you how smart you are since you picked the obvious correct one. 3. The ending is rediculous on many levels. 4. Much time is taken by the game while loading the next Act, Scene or whatever. Several minutes in some cases. Same when your character is killed and you have to restart that scene. 5. The main context, time travel, changes its own rules during the game - inconsistent. Shooting scenes are inconsistent. In some cases, you can kill all the bad guys in seconds. In others, it\\'s almost impossible without being \\'killed\\' a few times until you figure a workaround.  6. I found the controls to be lagging, depending on the scene, for no apparent reason. Replay the scene a few times, suddenly they\\'re perfect.  7. I play on Xbox One. There is sometimes a menu insert showing the buttons to use for various actions (slow time, etc). The icons on those buttons are just plain weird. I never did figure them out, just Googled and got a good list someone had posted. 8. The characters were attractive, believable, and well-acted. Yet for some reason several had to be killed off, no matter which options you choose. That added nothing to the main story in my opinion. 9. Did I mention the ending? It takes many tries to play thru the final fight, even on the Easy setting. In my case, probably a couple dozen tries.

After having let it charge I paired it with my PS3, following GIOTECK\\'s instructions, and found 2 major issues right off the bat.\\n\\n1: This headset IS NOT NOISE CANCELING despite of what the packaging, and GIOTECK\\'s website indicate. I had a neighbor over at the time I received it in the mail and asked her if she would help me test it. I sat at my desk with my PS3 and TV, while she sat opposite me across the 10ft. room. I asked her, soft spoken as she is, to speak to me while I had the headset active. She spoke just above a whisper and I could hear her clearly in the headset speaker. She clicked the mouse on the desk, across the room, and I could hear it in the headset speaker. This stunned me as I have been bothered numerous times by people who have headsets like this, which are not noise canceling, which pick up the slightest sounds in the room they are playing in such as their TV volume, their parents or siblings yelling at them, dogs barking in the next yard, and even cars driving by. On top of this, when these people use headsets like this it causes a doubling, or echoing effect when playing games. I can\\'t hear what is being said in a game because I am hearing the dialogue and sound effects twice as it overlaps through the co-op player\\'s headset. This EX-02 headset is NOT noise canceling with my neighbor speaking softly across the room. How am I supposed to not create an echoing effect for someone else when my TV is between my neighbor and I and not even on? If her voice comes through the headset it\\'s guaranteed that my TV volume will be the only thing a co-op partner will hear.\\n\\n2: There is also a recurring, tapping sound that comes through the headset speaker. It sounds like someone flicking a pie tin with their finger. It recurs so often, and is so loud that it causes the headset to be completely unusable.\\n\\nThere are some good things about the headset though. The LED lights on the unit are bright, clear, rich colors. The buttons are easy to press, and activate their functions nicely, and the interchangeable face plates are a nice touch, though difficult to change without feeling like you will void your warranty trying to pry them off. No instructions on how to change the face plates are included.\\n\\nThe included instruction pull out was easy to read and understand, in fact it\\'s one of the nicer, easier to read instruction literatures that I\\'ve seen in a long time with my favorite being, \"Point barrel toward enemy\".\\n\\nTo sum up, this EX-02 headset by GIOTECK is an attractive, lightweight design but fails terribly in its usable quality. Many would opt to state that, \"You get what you pay for\". I would submit that if a company manufactures a faulty product at a low price of $20.00, then gets even 100,000 people to buy it, then toss it in a drawer when it doesn\\'t function properly, that company just made $2,000,000.00 counting on those people saying, \"Well, you get what you pay for\".\\n\\nWell, as is, out of the box, and brand new, this EX-02 headset for the PS3 has worse usable quality than an analog phone.\\n\\nI purchased this headset so that I could pull it out of a bag, turn it on, and game it up without having to unpack a pair of headphones and connect all the cables and cords. After purchasing this headset, I find that I am still looking for a compact, easy to use, wireless, noise canceling headset, having not found the solution in the EX-02.',\n",

There is no such thing as a free lunch, somehow somewhere somebody is paying for it for something they want from it. If Ubi don't make a dime just giving away to the GTX 980 bundled, Ubi still get the promotion of their company. Why? even if ubisoft doesn't give it away, Jack Sparrow will let you play it at day 1 anyway.\\n\\nBUT... the Uplay thing that wannabe the same as Steam is the problem. So, I highly recommend any buyers to crack it if you just focus on single player. You'll see the magic, everything else will work very smooth after you stop the Uplay. Moreover, I tried to stream it with geforce, somehow Uplay won't let me in. Other ubisoft games are ok though.\\n\\nAnd cheaters are everywhere. There is mini games race that some people finish it in just 5 seconds as top leaderboard. That's impossible. I challenge you to do it in front of me without the help of hack or cheat code.\\n\\nAnd now, here is the problem. The moment you send a report for support, ubisoft will NOT help you. What they will do is asking the proof of purchase and all other things as if YOU are their ENEMY. Note that the evidence that some player is cheating is recorded and provided to ubisoft. Ubisoft won't help you for making report, they will first attack you.\\n\\nI recommend to buy it. BUT, with that crappy support from ubi, do NOT buy it at full price, wait for it until there is super big discount. If you still feel antsy to play it, borrow it from Jack Sparrow, and buy it later on.\\n\\nFar Cry 4 is a lot different from Far Cry 3.\\n-You can download fan made maps for your extra games, you can make your own game with it.\\n-There is co-op feature that gives a very interesting moments in every game you play. However, most people play solo. Join in co-op takes you forever. I've finished the game a couple times and until today I can only successfully 2 times playing co-op in PC. It's unbelievably sad. Most of the time, it's disconnected 5 seconds. For this, Ubisoft will argue with their made up excuses of course...\\n\\nYet, just so let you know... I don't have that problem with a 64 Multiplayer Battlefield 3 & 4 by DICE. Even if the multiplayer in Battlefield series has so many problems, yet I can still play it. Up to today I have more than 1000 hrs in BF3 and BF4 each, compare to any AAA title by ubisoft games combined hours average 30 hrs per game. Ubi games Price Value is not worth 50$ imo compare to Origin give away BF3 for Free to everybody last year.\\n\\nAnd there is no point to buy the game if the supports aren't exist.\\n\\nEDIT 1:\\nAfter the patch, I can get the co-op much easier than before, it's a good try. BUT.... there is always but, why? because it's Ubisoft. The Uplay prevent me use the MSI Afterburner to check the FPS and temp of my GPU. As soon as I turn on MSI Afterburner. Far Cry 4 stops working. Forget about recording your gameplay for Youtube channel. UNLESS, you crack it. Then everything will be fine. So that means, you cannot record your multiplayer experience with the software provided by your GPU. I got Far Cry 4 because of getting the NVIDIA GTX 980. So there should be all support cooperation between Ubisoft and NVIDIA. But not at this one particular game.\\n\\nAgain, you call ubisoft for this issue, they just say yea yea yea, we're doing something... I doubt it will be fixed by next year. Even the game Watch Dogs graphic at the advertisement VS real graphic quality now, after long time wait wait and wait, there isn't anything from ubisoft to deliver its promise.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I did a review on Far Cry 3, it's a lot stable than FC4. Yet it was still the same problem on Multiplayer matchmaking part of the game if you read my review. How many years was Far Cry 3 made? If ubisoft have a good intention, the multiplayer issue in FC4 should have been improved a lot than the FC3.\\n\\nStill, do NOT buy it at full price. 5$-ish is the right price for this game. Why? As the comparison. Battlefield 3 was ONLY 1$ when it was fixed thoroughly by DICE, and I spent more than 1000 hours of entertainment in it, Far Cry 3 less than 50$. Maybe I should dropped the star review on FC3, don't you think?\",\n",

As a matter of fact, having been burnt by the horrible game of Star Wars: The Old Republic, I did not even buy Mass Effect 3 (I read gamers\\' reviews first and it turns out not buying it was a good decision) and, most certainly, I will never preorder ANY game (no matter how much I want to preorder X-COM: Enemy Unknown).\\n\\nOver the last 5 years or so, game publishers have repeatedly lied to us, created incredible hype around their products, raised their prices to unbelievable, unprecedented levels and sold us TRASH... and WE bought said trash. It is time we all learned our lessons and collectively started doing a few things:\\n\\n- Deliberately ignore all game advertisements as well as all pre-launch statements, comments, promises and previews by game developers or their puppets such as GameSpot (would GameSpot give D3 a bad preview/review when D3 ads paid by Activision/Blizzard are all over the GS site?);\\n\\n- Never pre-order anything, ever; Just don\\'t. Ever;\\n\\n- Never buy ANY game until a couple of months have passed since launch date. Why? Not only because there may be some foolish, nave, trusting romantics who buy and review it before you but also because if no-one rushes to pay $70-80 for their (potentially trash) games, then in two months\\' time the price (in view of low demand) will have to drop to more reasonable levels of $40-50 or even less.\\n\\nIf we do this enough game publishers will have to change their unethical practices.\\n\\nVideo gaming (and especially computer gaming as opposed to console gaming) used to be a true art form and the games stimulated your mind and spirit.\\n\\nThe games of the last half decade have grown increasingly dumbed-down, streamlined, simplified, trivialized; they have turned into mainstream Hollywood assembly line of mass-produced garbage. Most of these games stimulate nothing but your mousing or button-mashing fingers and in the process insult your intelligence.\\n\\nIt is time to say to game publishers:\\n\\n- We want OUR gaming back;\\n- You will not tell us what\\'s good and force it down our throats until we like it;\\n- We will buy what we want and we refuse to buy what we DON\\'T want no matter how much YOU think we should like it;\\n\\nIt is time the gaming community stood up to the tyranny of Activisions, EAs and the like.\\n\\nIf you agree with the above, feel free to copy/paste on other sites/boards.',\n",

              " 'UPDATE! see the bottom of this review\\n\\nI\\'d like to start by stating my brief history with headsets. I\\'ve only really ever experienced TurtleBeach headsets, but with music I have used Bose. I owned Bose, the x11\\'s, and the XP300\\'s for a few months. I love the Bose and 11\\'s, hated the 300\\'s because they felt like my head was being squeezed even after trying to loosen them, and like the 510\\'s. For 15 days before I bought the 500\\'s and tried them but the interference was awful, plus they didn\\'t have built in rechargeable batteries.\\n\\nI contacted turtle beach about how tight the 300\\'s were and they said this was by design, so I was reluctant to try the 510\\'s. I haven\\'t experienced the same problem however so I kept them. I have experienced two other issues that you should consider before buying these and TB should not be proud of.\\n\\nIssue 1) Auto Shut-off: These headsets turn off if the source of audio is \"too quiet\". I have these hooked up to my computer via creative\\'s DDL with optical link and blue-tooth. With this sound card any digital hook-up has zero volume control. Instead it sends sound out at one volume that cannot be adjusted, which in my case happens to mean that my music on media player must be set at 10% or higher to keep the audio level \"above the threshold\" for the auto-shut off timer. This is a problem because sometimes my games don\\'t play sound above that threshold, which means I need to keep media player in the background just to keep the headset on. Which is distracting, and no one should ever have to make such compromises on such an expensive piece of equipment. The auto-shut off is non-programmable.\\n\\nIssue 2) Audio: if you plan on using these for computer, when you\\'re not actively listening to something, the digital processor at the transmitter turns off IMMEDIATELY, and takes seconds to turn back on. This translates to: the first few seconds of any song you play, or any game, audio test, ANYTHING is cut-off because the transmitter simply isn\\'t on. To fix this I must keep music playing in the background at 10% at ALL times if I don\\'t want to experience this. This headset wasn\\'t expressly made for pc, but TB had to know that a $300 headset wouldn\\'t sit at one console in its life cycle.\\n\\nRemember that to use these for computer you will need something with DDL, and a blue-tooth adapter on the pc.\\n\\nProgrammability: Now on to the rest of the review, the reason I bought this headset was for the programmable microphone. See I play at night on the Xbox a lot, so I have to whisper. Almost all headsets don\\'t pick up on whispers though, so I hoped these could be programmed to. They are, but it\\'s not simple at first glance. Specifically you must turn up not the XBL and BT output volume or even the silencer threshold, but for XBL and even computer games to pick up on your voice you need to boost the equalizer. When you do this you will be able to whisper now. 5 stars\\n\\nAs for the rest of the programming options, I haven\\'t got into that because it\\'s complex and from the looks of it you can do almost anything you want. Very promising potential to adjust it exactly the way you want. N/A stars\\n\\nComfort: they don\\'t hurt, unlike the 300\\'s. I have worn them for hours on end without issue. 4 stars\\n\\nAudio: I\\'m no audiophile so I can\\'t say much. They work, and do have bass. They seem fine. 4  stars\\n\\nBlue-tooth: this works on my phone, on my computer, google voice, and so on. Seems to work like a blue-tooth should.  Everything I\\'ve tried works and without interference. 5 stars\\n\\nWireless: I personally don\\'t experience much issue with the interference on these headphones. Sure occasionally I get static or something here and there but it\\'s never been an issue and some of it is to be expected. I have noticed that it does work better when the left ear cup is closer to the transmitter. 4  stars\\n\\nTransmitter: I like the stand for the headset, but Issue 2 is a problem for me. I wish there was still a headphone jack for friends. For issue 2 I give it 2 stars, because I shouldn\\'t have to jump through hoops to keep it working right.\\n\\nMicrophone: It\\'s programmable in any way you want, what\\'s not to like? 5 stars\\n\\nXBL adapter: it works without issue so far, sometimes I accidently bump the button on it with my belly while gaming so watch out for that. 4  stars\\n\\nCharging cable: it\\'s long and it works, but you can feel it pointing down on your shoulder. Makes me worried that I might wear the connection port out one day from this, 4  stars\\n\\nData Cable: it\\'s a little too short, you\\'ll need a laptop or move you xbox to your monitor to use this. 3 stars\\n\\nSurround Sound: it\\'s not breath taking, but it\\'s nice. Honestly I didn\\'t fiddle with this too much and feel that it could be better. But again, I didn\\'t play with the settings on this speaker positioning enough on this to give it a fair review. So I\\'ll just go with 4 stars for now\\n\\nOverall I\\'m happy with the headset. I didn\\'t experience issue 1 while on the Xbox. I haven\\'t used it on the PS3 yet, save for Netflix. While browsing on Netflix the auto-off did kick in, and it\\'s F annoying. However during console gaming and actual streaming I had no issue myself.  I would buy these again, but if someone made the same thing without issue 1 I wouldn\\'t.\\n\\nsorry for the long review\\n\\nUPDATE: 6/1/2014\\n\\nIt turns out, these aren\\'t worth it. I\\'m playing Hitman: Blood Money on the 360 with all the game sounds set to %100 and the power saving feature keeps turning my headset off, so I have to leave my wireless headset plugged into it\\'s charger just so they stay turned on. so everything I said before about it being decent is now debunked because it won\\'t stay on. Turtle Beach screwed up, anyone who tried this for an hour on a handful of games could have quickly spotted this before releasing the product. The device is properly setup, i am 100% sure it is not an error on my end.\\n\\nupdate: 7/26/2015\\njust wanted to add that i recently tried the elite 800\\'s, and for the money it\\'s a terrible buy. turtlebeach is now on my blacklist and i suggest you never buy without a return policy in mind. then when you do, if it even slightly bothers you or something you don\\'t return it without question. they seem to be develiping a trend of products that have alot of flaws that any ordinary person would hate for the price.',\n",

Also the site you register the game at has fees for using characters after a limited amount of time and if you don't use your account after a year. I appreciate the fact they have no inital monthly fee. But if they are going to make you pay to use your own character, they should count that as a monthly (daily, weekly, hourly, ect.) fee. And they should state there will be such fees before you take on the long download time of this game. I think your time would be better spent on xbox (xbox 360, wii, Nintendo, Playstation) games that carry the Final Fantasy games. They are also fun, have no added fees, and cost nothing to play once the purchase price is paid.

OK, they're ports of first-gen Playstation titles for the most part, and while that isn't wrong in itself (70% of the GBA's library is made of SNES ports or adaptations), it's all in the execution, and with poor control and the lousy aspect ratio, it's already gone belly up, not to mention these blocky 3D graphics are so much more painful on the eyes than something like, say, the nice smooth sprites of an Advance Wars.

Multiplayer is wireless and adequately implemented, but that's about the only plus, and there's only a couple of titles taking advantage of that, too.

              " \"For a while, I was torn between purchasing Operation Darkness or this game, Spectral Force 3.  Both are strategy RPGs, and both are by Atlus.  I decided on Operation Darkness, and it was surprising fun.  So Spectral Force seemed like a no-brainer.  At first glance, it looked a lot like the wonderful Shining Force series of games.  Even the name seemed to tie in to the old series.  But beyond that, this game is no Shining Force.\\n\\nProblem:  The control scheme is very counter-intuitive.  It's simple enough to move about the game terrain, but the attack setup is murky at best.  There are different strength attacks, depending on what button you push.  Of course, the game doesn't explain that, and the game book is similarly useless.\\n\\nAnother problem:  The enemies appear in stages and not all at once.  That works fine for Operation Darkness, because the maps are huge.  Not so much in this game.  You kill three enemies, and suddenly, there are three more standing behind you.  It's hard to coordinate attacks when you cannot anticipate the enemies' location.\\n\\nAnother problem:  The hub you return to after missions gives you practically no information, or hints about creating items and armors.  You find random junk during battles and you can create new gear after the fact.  But what will the new armors and weapons do?  Are you making something really powerful, or is it just more useless stuff? The game doesn't really tell you.\\n\\nAnother problem.  Let me get this straight . . . the healer in your party cannot heal himself outright?  You have to acquire a spell after the fact?  He has no problem healing the other party members, so why can't he heal himself?  That didn't make any sense, and it makes even less sense after the character dies constantly.\\n\\nFinal problem: In between missions, there are static cut scenes with dialogue, moving the story forward.  This is where the game likes to freeze.  Now an occasional freeze is forgivable, but not when it occurs on a consistent basis.  You beat the mission, watch the cutscene, the game freezes, you cannot save, start over.  That's unforgivable.\\n\\nForget this game.\",\n",

              " 'What if the Nazis had won world war two?  For that matter, what if, having conquered all of Europe, Hitler\\'s armies invaded the United States?  Imagine that you\\'re a construction worker on a building when suddenly, missiles slam into the girders around you.  Looking up, you see the impossible...a fleet of Nazi zeppelins descending upon your city, accompanied by a fleet of warships, and backed up with hundreds upon hundreds of jets and fighters sweeping among the skyscrapers, blasting everything in sight.\\n\\nIt\\'s a terrific premise for a video game, but unfortunately, that\\'s all \"Turning Point\" has going for it.\\n\\n\"Turning Point\" is your standard first person shooter.  You run around shooting those dastardly Nazis, gathering and swapping weapons as needed, and interacting with the environment at various moments to activate bridges, man machine gun turrets, and plant bombs.  All pretty standard affairs with nothing too extraordinary, save for being able to occasionally grapple an enemy in hand to hand combat, whereupon you can either take them hostage as a human shield, or kill them easily.  While most of those kills are variations of knocking them out with your fists, bashing them with weapons, etc. a few are occasionally quite humorous, such as chucking a paratrooper off a skyscraper, tossing a thug into a furnace and locking the doors shut (Irony!), or drowning one unfortunate soldier in a toilet bowl.\\n\\nHowever, aside from its instant kills and the fantastic premise, \"Turning Point\" doesn\\'t really work, for the simple fact that it feels unfinished.  With such a Hollywood caliber premise, the story in \"Turning Point\" is practically non-existent, outside of a handful of cut scenes.  Characters come and go at random, and are all equally forgettable.  The player character is a construction worker who wears a red shirt and has no personality, motives, or goals, and is frequently sent in by trained marines to do their dirty work.\\n\\nGameplay is average, with not much to distinguish it.  Your foes are competent, though not particularly smart.  They\\'ll attack you en mass to try and make up for their average AI, which largely resorts to ducking behind obstacles and chucking LOTS of grenades (one big problem: the grenade indicator does not tell you how close a grenade is to your position, which makes it nearly impossible to figure out if you\\'re going to get hit or not).  If you take too much damage, you have to retreat to heal, which happens very quickly, as you heal in about three seconds, no matter how much damage you take.  However, this won\\'t help you in the last third of the game, which throws hordes of enemies your way who have much better accuracy then their first and second level counterparts.  In one nightmarishly difficult sequence on a bridge, you\\'ll be assaulted by at least ten guys with rockets, rapid fire sniper rifles, combat shotguns, a few blimps, and even a giant zeppelin.  Add in the fact that checkpoints are few and far between, and the last act of the game, or most of the game for that matter, just isn\\'t any fun.\\n\\nIn keeping in line with the thin story, levels are connected by the barest of threads.  At the beginning of the game, your goal is to escape and head to Washington.  After a cut scene, you\\'re suddenly in a safe house and have to defend it, with no explanation of how you got there, or what you were doing there in the first place.  This jumpy feeling pervades every area of the game, and as a result, we have no emotional interest in it.  Even when we\\'re told that the fate of the world is in our hands, we just don\\'t care.  There\\'s so much potential in this world for a great story, and it\\'s left completely untapped.  When the end credits rolls around, we\\'re left wondering why we didn\\'t see more of it.  Is Hitler still alive?  Does Canada and Mexico join forces with the United States?  What about Japan and Russia?  We never find out the answers to these questions, and countless others.\\n\\nIt\\'s a shame really.  While the first level of the game does an outstanding job immersing you in the world, once you exit the skyscraper, it all goes down hill.  \"Turning Point\" is proof that a fantastic idea can only go so far without good execution.  While it has an outstanding premise and a fantastic opening sequence, a non-existent story, poor characters, and unfinished feel make it a dull game that is ultimately not worth your time.',\n",

There's no changing the resolution or the color depth, so it runs at what appears to be 640x480 or something with a very low color depth.  Everything's grainy with banding due to lack of color.\\nThe next biggest problem is that the navigation is terrible.  You move forward by clicking when you randomly pass the cursor over the right spot and the cursor turn to the right shape.  But, to turn, you either have to use the cursor keys (which do an instantaneous turn instead of a pan, so it's hard to hold an image in your head of where you are), or you click and PUSH the mouse in the direction you want to turn instead of clicking and dragging the window in that direction (and the pan is so fast you can't see the scenery go by).  There's no cursor change in those cases.  Then, if you can look up or down, the only indication you have is a change to an icon down below the scene in your inventory.  Plus, the cursor shape indicating a possible path is very easy to confuse as to where it's really pointing.  In some cases, clicking forward will turn you 45 degrees before proceeding to take you somewhere nowhere near where it looked like it would take you.  In other cases, you think it's pointing somewhere you've been, but it's not (so you miss a path).  You end up watching the cursor and thinking about the mechanics of movement instead of looking at the scenery and tying to figure out what's going on.  Also irritating is that once you click to go forward, it will stop at multiple, non-significant spots (even on straight, non-divertable paths).  So, you spend time sweeping the cursor over everything in every direction wondering what's so important that the game stopped you here.\\nBut, the biggest problem is the puzzles themselves.  The charitable description would be that they're impossibly hard.  A more accurate description is that there's neither rhyme nor reason to them.  In some cases, there's no indication that a device IS a puzzle and not just a static display.  If you don't have a necessary inventory item, you can't do anything and there's no indication that you could EVER do anything in it.  If you have some random inventory item that it expects, it just changes the cursor in the right place (if you happen to cross the spot) and you drop it on.  In others, the puzzle is so vague that you're not even sure what you're supposed to be doing with it or why.  Then you have to work your way through multiple, non-easily-written notation systems or phonetics.  In my case, I uninstalled the game when it became obvious that it wanted me to reproduce some long string of barely heard, non-phonetically-writeable, background-noise-filled, alien speech on a set of devices strewn in four or six places about a very large room.\\nImpossible.

The controller will not work on consoles especially on the ps4 where steam runs as well. the controller is big and its meant for hands bigger than me, say gabe newells. i believe this controller was made to please gabe newell himself otherwise he wouldnt have invested as much in it without going to VCs or Crowdfunding.

The controller in the picture looks very well made. It's flat black and the material looks comparable to the best Sony controllers out there. Not at all representative of what you'll receive and they shouldn't be allowed to use that picture. What you'll get is glossy, cheap plastic that weighs so close to nothing at all that it might confuse you at first. I'd honestly like to see whats inside it because I'd bet it's hilarious. There's no mic plug for a headset. There's no vibration. It's wired. The triggers are very shallow and have to be pressed hard to work. This might be the worst controller I've ever seen. And that's okay BUT $50? It shouldn't be a penny more than $10 and after seeing the thing, you'd most likely want your $10 back. The regular Sony controller is MASSIVELY better than this.

I purchased the PC digital deluxe edition (80 bucks down the drain)and the only truly decent part of the game is the ashes DLC! I have been only able to import 3 of my Shepard character out of some 9 having completed ME1 and ME2! I find that any choices i had made have little or no effect in ME3! Worse still this game is rather short it is almost as if it is geared more toward co-op than actual single player! Added to that the games has rather annoying bugs such as freezing up movement to weapons not firing and even powers not working! While i expect the bugs to be fixed with patches eventually, i find that the story is the true disappointment!\\n\\nSPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!\\n\\nI had chosen Anderson  as the council member in nearly all my characters save 1. When ME3 starts udina is the council member and Anderson is an admiral! What a complete waste!\\n\\nI had chosen to save the rachni queen! In ME3 she is controlled by the reapers and i get the glorious opportunity ti either save her again or kill her! I had chosen to save her again thinking I might get something good or useful! What i get is a foot note about the rachni helping on the crucible! YAY! I am better off saving grunts company!\\n\\nAnother let down is the idiotic dream sequences (lost count of how many there are) where my Shepard gets to move real slow chasing a dead kid that does not show or tell me any important things related to the game! It is utterly pointless!\\n\\nAnother and perhaps the biggest let down is the ME3 choice system my choices where the most logical and reasonable ones i could possible make (not import ME1 or ME2 choices) yet the outcomes are rather different from what you are expecting. For instance the quarians ask for help to free their trapped fleet. I help them to get their fleet free and instead they attack the geth dreadnaught while i am on board it instead of retreating to safety. I later learn despite my choice (in ME2) to have the qurians not attack the geth i learn it was the quarians who started the war with the geth who were acting peaceful! When i try to fix the issue by saving admiral khoris he commits suicide! I got so pissed i just let the geth kill all the quarians which resulted in tali committing suicide. Ultra LAME!\\n\\nThese are but a few of the many problems with this game! But hey at least the co-op is decent right? I should have just stuck with the free demo. ME3 is anything but epic. At best this game rates a 3.5 and that is only for the barely decent third person shooter that this game is! The RPG element of this game is merely an after thought at best.\\n\\nAnd while i do find the orgin requirement annoying you can just download a crack to by pass the orgin but you will have to forgo your DLC which is not really worth it as ashes is perhaps the only real fun part of this game.',\n",

The shots do not come off right, the shooting animation is so slow that you can have a wide open guy on the wing and by the time he gets up and into the air and release the shot, a defender can make up serious ground and block it.  Against the computer, I had JJ Reddick and Turkoglu blocked 5 times apiece by Mourning and Shaq coming from the basket on what were wide open shots.

The rosters were supposed to be as of Aug. 24th, but where is Turiaf? And why is Battie a FA, he was never renounced or waived!\\n\\nThe press box angle is actually not bad. I dunno why Live insists on having their players pass in uncoventional ways, things like hook-shot style passes, behind the backs, even though the situation does not need those. The subsitution is also clunky; you can do the sub using the D-pad during a break in the action, but by the time you select the player you are bringing in, the game resumes leaving you with the same people on the court.\\n\\nThe timeouts are also timed, as in if you call a 20, there is a 20 second clock and so on.

Like an addict, I had to get my fix. So to say that this game was unfulfilling is a polite understatement. This is a game that was so vastly disappointing to me that it's taken awhile to calm down enough to write about it.\\n\\nLet's talk about the good things, because it will be brief. Aliens Colonial Marines started off on a good note. Sure, the graphics were disappointing after such a long development cycle, but it's forgivable, at first, because your just so bloody EXCITED to start playing. Again at first, it's good. It's atmospheric, it uses the sounds and lighting in great ways. You feel tense, and it's perfect. It's the kind of Aliens game that you've been waiting for.\\n\\nSadly, for single player, that's about where the good things end. Multi-player provides a decent experience, even if the weapons are terrible and the game types are dated. Imagine the multi-player as Left 4 Dead, where all the Zombies have been removed and you're just playing against special infected. It's fun, and it provides its thrills, but eventually you do start to feel drained by it.\\n\\nAs is typical for the more recent additions to the Aliens video games, this is simply another disappointment in a long string of disappointments. The game engine is weak, to a point where it's more common for the game to glitch out and break down than work properly. The weapons are terrible. Whats the point of being able to carry so many if they all suck?\\n\\nAt first the pulse rifle is pretty great, and in single player it is legitimately the go-to weapon. Things like the flame thrower, smart gun and turrets are a blast, but eventually, like everything else, they simply fall way short of the mark.\\n\\nThe AI is a disaster. The aliens in single player are so predictable that you can count on them to ALWAYS make a bee line for you unless your playing in co-op. Your `friendly' marine AI is so bad it almost seems like they take pleasure in watching you get mauled to death and they will literally watch an alien beat you to death without doing a single thing to save you.\\nWorse, you can actually shoot THROUGH your teammates as if they weren't there, and vice versa, the aliens can leap through the AI characters like they were phantoms. The hit boxes are a wreck, with the only consistent thing being that head shots don't count as head shots. Character animations are choppy, to be nice about it, and how they interact with the game world is so terrible that it's common for you to `trip' on a rough edge in a level and get insta gibbed by fall damage.\\n\\nAs for the story line, it's confusing to me that for the first 10 minutes, they get the recipe right only to have it just crash and burn. It's almost as if they intentionally worked only on the parts they would display for the previews, and just went `Meh, who cares.' I'll give you an example, and I'm sorry for the spoilers, but for the majority of the game, YOU DON'T EVEN FIGHT ALIENS.\\n\\nFor whatever asinine reason, most of this game is spent fighting the private militia of the Weyland-Yutani Corp. I guess having us play a game that's based on the premise of fighting Aliens was just too much for the good people at Gearbox/TimeGate Studios to handle. It's a move that had me shaking my head, because how did this make sense to anyone during development? `Lets make a game about fighting aliens, but you barely ever get to fight aliens.' Sure, sound plan, makes perfect sense.\\n\\nAliens Colonial Marines isn't just a disappointing game, because it's not simply bad, for a `game of passion,' that Gearbox was so utterly fanatic about, this is a travesty. It's a crappy game with the Aliens brand name slapped on top, a more blatant cash grab than I care to consider. This is nigh unforgivable. And to add insult to injury, insider leaks are pointing to the fact that Gearbox lied to us about how much control and work they actually put into the game. Important figureheads at Gearbox are on record saying that they were responsible for something like '80%' of the game, when in fact it turns out that they may have designed a level or two in Multi-player. Maybe. Turns out that TimeGate Studios has been in charge of this `hellish development cycle,' for years now, and they are responsible for making the majority of this game. Why lie about it? Well TimeGate has a rather dismal record when it comes to making games. You might remember them for, well, nothing really. They've never been able to produce a quality game, although to be honest, they have a really clever PR department.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, all my ranting boils down to two points; This game is awful, and the only redeeming factor about it is Multi-player, but even that is a tedious, glitchy and rage inducing affair. Do yourself a favor and rent this one if your really curious, I know from checking earlier today that Redbox is already carrying this. Regardless of whatever nostalgic feelings you might have towards this brand, this game utilizes the Aliens name as little more than a hollow gimmick to reel you in and steal your money. Honestly, this game is so bad it's not even worth the bandwidth required to pirate it.\\n\\nFor the folks giving me flak about the original review; Go look it up on Youtube you poor saps.\\nIt is possible to beat this game in 3 hours, at max difficulty settings, if you don't play like a drunken chimpanzee.\\nIf your competent enough to figure out where the dev's might have dropped a spawn point or a trigger, you can literally run through most of this game without having to fire a shot.[...]or youtube 'Aliens Colonial Marines Pacifist Mode' for a really great example of how easy it is.)\\n\\nRent this if you can. If you already bought it, my condolences.\",\n",

              " 'First, the Good:\\n\\nGood CGI: Or I should say, competent CGI. Nothing on the level of say, Squaresoft, but competent all-around. Nothing surprising there.\\n\\nExcellent voicework: like prior games, great acting scenes are numerous here, although in many scenes the lines sort of fall flat. Again I must say that I was very disappointed in the story arc, which seemed to pay no attention to the tiny golden details of the first two games. About midway through the game I was left scratching my head at many inconsistencies and plotholes that were a result of obvious laziness on the part of Bioware devs.\\n\\nMusic is...competent. Nothing grand like Skyrim. It is sort of...\"boopy\". If you\\'re expecting something \"spacey\" like Michael Stearns or Steve Roach, forget it. Even Star Control II (3do) had better music.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n\\nThe homo-sexual angle isn\\'t just subtle like the former games I had played, but rather right in-your-face and had a dare-you-to-say-anything-about-it mentality about them. Is this a video game for kids, or adults? Is it a space opera or a game about gay politics? It was very distracting and had absolutely NO place in the Mass Effect universe. Totally depraved and irresponsible of Ray (CEO) to shove this into the game. I guess we now know what side of the aisle he is on.\\n\\nFamiliarity breeds...very familiar territory as you cut down swarms of stormtrooper-like cerebus troops, geth and cerebus engineers. However, this really started grinding on my nerves after playing for ten hours and seeing the same enemies time after time, much like Gears of War. What the combat lacks is variety of enemies, and some DEPTH to the environments, the kind Fallout 2 had. In short, it lacks a soul. I started to realize that it wasn\\'t an RPG I was playing, but a FPS in the vein of Call of Duty or Gears of War, yet Bioware bills this as an RPG! That is a blatant lie. While I enjoy Gears of War...I know what to expect. The Gears of War devs don\\'t bill their epic SHOOTER as anything other than a fps and not an rpg (and honestly, stealing the cover system from Gears of War was just silly).\\n\\nBioware has fallen. This isn\\'t completely the fault of EA. After doing some research on who had played a big part in the creation of the greatest RPG of the 21st century, Baldurs Gate II, I learned that most of the guys that made *that* game have long since left Bioware for greener pastures. Still, Bioware had a duty to re-fill those positions with the brightest minds in the industry, and instead chose people who were experts not at creating absorbing rpg games, but rather those that are experts at creating mindless propaganda pieces, filled with cookie-cutter levels/enemies and ignoring the fans. It is as if NO ONE who worked on Mass Effect 1 had any input on this game. Perhaps the brass tossed the new designers a mass effect 1 disc and said \"here, have a look at this if you have time\"?\\n\\nOrigin. Nothing more I can say that hasn\\'t already been stated.\\n\\nMinor Spoiler Alert:\\nAnd what exactly was the deal with stealing a picture off of the net (Tali)? Surely with a multi-million dollar budget, the developers could have done a better job at this?\\n\\nI will never buy another Bioware game again. Ever.\\n\\nPerhaps the two CEOs of Bioware should go back into medicine. They have clearly let the money and fame go to their head.',\n",

If you freeze glitch near an enemy it\\'s game over or if in mid jump it glitch drops you straight down.....hence killing you instantly as 99% of the levels with exception of level 1 world 1 are pits.  The multiplayer in this game is \"trip over the other players feet\" style which I hate just like Battletoads on NES.  For a simple Mario game the controls are mangled, unresponsive and sometimes have a damn mind of their own.  The layout is simple but the response time from the game doesn\\'t match the buttons your pushing most of the time and you end up dead. I have still yet to figure out if the game was made this way or not.  The sliding around, the delayed or no jump sometimes when you hit jump while running and terrible hit detection combined with the 99% pit levels is maddening at times.  I fail to see how this game is for kids, if more than one is playing this at the same time they will probally choke eachother...even single player is to difficult for kids with all the precision pit jumping required.  The cut scenes could have been so much better and actually have effort put into them rather then having the same exact scene 12 times when you beat castles.  I have beaten the game from start to finish worlds 1-9 three times over and overall it was a frustrating as hell experience due to the games horrid controls, mangled hit detection, tired endless pit levels and savagely crippled multiplayer.  The lack of innovation here also took away from this game as it is a carbon copy of New Super Mario Bros DS.\\n\\nUpdate:  They just re-released this game with a new Racoon power up on the Wii U.  The game is titled \"New\" Super Mario Bros U, if they are going to keep doing re-hashes they should just call it \"New\" Super Mario Bros Recycled, it\\'s a far more honest and fitting title if they are charging 60+ dollars for this game everytime they release it over and over again.',\n",

I then went back to the Main Menu options, chose edit for each control box, and steered the wheel, pressed the pedals, and pressed the buttons of the Thrustmaster to have the settings necessary to operate my wheel recognized.

Many reviewers are noticing the rampant glitches in this year's version--many more than were in MLB 2K8, which wasn't all that smoothly done in the first place--and what they are reporting is accurate if, perhaps, understated.  In terms of its programming, this game is a disaster.

It'll be disappointing not having a new baseball game this year, but maybe if everyone leaves this dog on the shelf either MLB properties will reconsider and send the license back to EA, or 2K will fire their entire design team and start over.  At this point, either solution would likely result in a major improvement.\\n\\nEDIT\\n\\nI've talked this over with a number of friends, and we all agree--the enforced yearly output for sports video game franchises is killing the quality of the games.  There is, literally, no time for major innovation, good quality control, etc.  We've all agreed the following solution would work and hope you agree:  Put out a new title once every two or even three years--offering downloadable ($) roster and rating updates for each new season between generations of the game.  Giving these studios more time to focus on quality and innovation would probably lead to increased game sales.  I did not purchase MLB 2K9 this year, choosing to rent it first instead since I was disappointed with the last two or three iterations of the franchise .  And, needless to say, won't be buying it.

It\\'s strange, because my computer will recognize when it\\'s plugged in as any sound will try and shoot to the device, but since the actual Recon3D itself won\\'t light up (ie, turn on), it can\\'t connect to my Omega headphones, thus defeating the purpose.\\nI\\'ve emailed Creative to see what the issue could be.\\n\\nUPDATE 12/13/11:\\nI\\'ve kept the original review below. It turns out I was missing the card, but Creative was gracious enough to send it to me so I can experience the full sound explosion in its glory. As a company, they rock. Their products are amazing, albeit overpriced.\\n\\nPairing the Omega headphones with their Recon3D was easy with the TacticLink (though I did have trouble at first), and the sounds is fantastic. I tested Star Wars on Blu-ray, and, sure enough, there was a huge difference from just using the Recon3D with $20 Sennheisers. Not only do the headphones make a difference, but the Recon3D does a magnificent job of imitating true THX sound. Having the Recon3D, it eliminates the cords from the Omega connecting to the TV and PS3. You only need to connect the Recon3D via USB to the PS3 and the optical cable (included) from the PS3 to the TV, and that\\'s it. The Omega headphones sit comfortably on their rest, no other cords, pucks, plugs necessary.\\n\\nIt\\'s fantastic for console gaming, but at $300 for both, it\\'s too pricey, considering that you can find some with slightly less sound quality for under $100. While it\\'s multi-platform (though I\\'ve only used it with the PS3 and Macbook Pro), the price can detract some, but the sound quality makes it worth it.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nShouldn\\'t it be the opposite? I have Creative\\'s Tactic 3D Omega headphones, and got the Recon 3D to pair with it. It should be easier, shouldn\\'t it? With their own products?\\nUnfortunately, that isn\\'t the case.\\n\\nWhile I have praised the Recon3D, that\\'s only because I\\'m using them with my $20 Sennheisers. That\\'s where the two stars come. It gets docked enormously for the fact that Creative leaves out the TacticLink, a piece that is REQUIRED to pair their own headphones wirelessly. Unfortunately, the two items separately do not come with the TacticLink, but the bundle does--? If you buy the bundle, you save over $75, but it comes with a component that you need to pair the items. You can pair the headphones with the Recon3D, but by cable only, and I don\\'t have the necessary cable to accomplish that.\\n\\nTherefore, their pricing is extremely skewed, and the fact that you have to pay over $75 more for both items separately when you don\\'t even get the necessary (\"optional,\" as Creative says) component to get the full, wireless experience, make this customer a very unhappy one. Heck, I can\\'t even get the full experience at all because the Tactic 3D Omega can\\'t connect to the Recon3D unless I go out and buy the cable, let alone \"optional\" TacticLink, thus leaving me behind the full enjoying experience.\\n\\nIt\\'s a shame because I defended the Omega in another review, but here\\'s where it stops.',\n",

I\\'ve been to 3 systems, 10 planets, and 2 space stations. Everyone one, full of identical buildings, same stuff, different colors. A massive station in space with only 2 rooms. The flavor text on every conversation and temple/monolith I visit is a joke, while it isn\\'t intended to be (frozen gas? FROZEN GAS? STATES OF MATTER ANYONE??). This game is clearly a circlejerk for the devs at Hello Games, and I wouldn\\'t recommend it to anyone at full price. All in all, I am not sure what these people are doing saying this game is amazing? The universe is \"infinite\" but with only 5 or so tasks to perform repetitively and really no immersion at all it feels pathetically small. Games like Grand Theft Auto and Witcher 3 feel so so much larger, richer, and fuller than this game even comes close to.\\n\\nExtremely dissapointed.',\n",

              " \"With all the hype I thought this game would be something special, what it turned out to be was a thankfully short, boring stinker. The story was lame and the action tedious and redundant. Also a few years before the game was actually released all the previews were totally different, there were images a cloaked baddies, and a totally interactive environment. This game feels like it started out as a huge sprawling sandbox action/adventure/horror/mystery then due to budget cuts ended up a lame shooter.\\n\\nGraphics -\\n+ Nice, environments were very detailed\\n- Environments all looked the same.\\n\\nCombat\\nInnovative system of breaking down enemy shields with a flash light then shooting them to kill them. Cool at first, gets old real fast.\\n\\nGame-play -\\nThis game consists of going from point a to point b and getting to a plot point then repeat. There are 3 types of enemies, and a couple of unimaginative bosses (a back-hoe for example). The environments while nicely detailed all look the same, with little to no thought in the level design, often you just head in a straight line through a generic forest, a generic building, or a generic office. The is combat fun at first, but once the novelty wears off (about 15-20 minutes) it get's boring. what makes matters worse is the cheap shots the enemies take. You'll find yourself just walking along or worse, fighting off a horde of baddies, when all of a sudden they start spawning right behind you, basically right on top of you. This happens so often and becomes so damn frustrating that you'll be tempted to quit, not due to the challenge but due to the fact that the game just isn't fun enough t keep you caring. I finished the game in a day, yeah it's that short, and that easy (minus the cheap shots.)\\n\\nRe-Playability -\\nNone, getting through this stinker once is a test of will-power\\n\\nVerdict -\\nPossible rental, if it's cheap, or borrow it from an unfortunate friend who got taken in by the slick packaging.

              " 'By now, I think most of the people reading this review will have already played Rayman 2. That being the case, not much of Rayman 3D will be a surprise, but that\\'s not why you were looking at this game. You wanted to play one of the best platformers ever made, with all the rich level design, great musical score, and of course, the platforming, as well as the action you expect. Of course you expect that, because this is an adaptation of Rayman 2 for the dreamcast, regarded as one of the best ports of this game (of which there are many, but that\\'s for another discussion)!\\n\\nSo, how can you go wrong? You already know this game. You know it\\'s great, and now you\\'ll know what it\\'s like to play it with enhanced graphics, 3D, and portability, without any compromise to quality like in Rayman DS, or with the somewhat lessened quality of the PS1 port which is now available to play on PS3, PS Vita, and PSP. I\\'m sure most of you currently know how sarcastic I\\'m being, because this 3DS port is not nearly as flawless as one would think.\\n\\nThe things that ruin this game probably sound nitpicky to an outsider. Even I tried to resolve to deal with the negative because of how much I love Rayman 2. The fact of the matter is, most of them are technical. Rayman 2 is still a great game, and you can experience the PC version for reasonably cheap. But on the 3DS, Rayman 2 looks a little broken. Not much like its normal self, this version of Rayman 2 is full of glitches, framerate issues, even things as small as sound issues. Anyone who has played the original game at length would immediately spot these problems.\\n\\nLet me describe to you an experience I had just moments ago. I was just playing the second level of the game, The Fairy Glade as it\\'s called. The first thing I notice is that in the starting area, the framerate is all over the place. From silky smooth to what I\\'d have to guess is 15fps. If you don\\'t know what that means, just trust me, it\\'s not good. After progressing a bit, I come upon a giant machine pumping sludge into a river. I climb up into this machine and walk through it like normal, like in the original game, but something is off. Upon further examination, it turned out that most of the inner walls of this machine were invisible from the inside. If you go to first person view mode from within and look outward, the entire thing disappears and you can see parts of the map you were never supposed to. After marveling at the lack of playtesting, I moved along to another area with a large waterfall, another river, vines along a cliff side, and jumping pirhannas. Remarkably, this area seems relatively okay except for the framerate being kinda slow. As I make it to the other side safely, I peer back over to the vines I had just climbed across and notice that one of the pirhannas is frozen in mid air. Actually, I don\\'t recall there ever being a pirhanna there to begin with. Just a random one, floating, completely still, like someone edited it in and forgot to delete it. At about this point, I turned off the game because I was disgusted.\\n\\nThere are numerous other glitches. In one level, you look upward and see that there are two skies. One of them is not supposed to be there, the other, clipped off at the cliff side for some reason. In another level, you free your friend \"Ssssam\" from a cage, but strangely enough, there are two of them! One of them is a fake, the other one can be used to traverse the level like normal. In some areas, in 3D, you can actually see through walls and such. Then there are less cosmetic issues. In The Iron Hills, you start out in an area that is downpouring so hard that it\\'s effecting all the 2D objects in the area! Your shadow, your hair, lums, smoke, all sorts of things are barely visible because every raindrop that intersects them makes it disappear. If you like hunting for lums in that area, you\\'ll only be slightly worse off finding them with your eyes closed. Speaking of which, this brings me to one glitch I haven\\'t even encountered but everyone has talked about. The 1000th lum glitch! Apparently, there\\'s a secret area in the game where you can find the very last, 1000th lum, but unfortunately, the method you use to get to it in the normal versions of the game is broken in this one. It involves a web hammock that you use as a trampoline, except, it doesn\\'t bounce you at all, it just pretends like it\\'s a platform. This makes getting to the lum almost impossible, unless you do some kind of convoluted technique of getting shot by an enemy or something, which hopefully bounces you high enough to get up to the ledge you need to get to to snag the lum. So, great, you can\\'t even really beat the game by collecting all the lums. Oh, and I forgot to mention, the audio is screwed up too. Unless you turn your music down to about 10%, good luck hearing sound effects even when they\\'re on max. Other issues I\\'ve heard of include music switching abruptly, some dialogue not being spoken or spoken strangely or out of sync, etc. I can go on listing off glitches, but I think you get the point.\\n\\nBasically, Rayman 3D is a bad port of an awesome game, and doesn\\'t deserve this treatment. If you want to play the real Rayman 2, it\\'s available on GOG for less than $10, with some bonus content, and it plays natively in HD (and still looks surprisingly good at 1080p). If you have any computer that\\'s less than 5 years old, I can almost guarantee you it\\'ll run great, and older computers will probably perform just as well too. If you still have a Dreamcast, try and find that version of the game, because people love it and it\\'s got some neat little extras that the PS1, PC, and N64 versions didn\\'t have. This version just isn\\'t worth your money, and no matter how many dimensions they add, it\\'ll still be a terrible port.',\n",

These were kids who started playing the series once Code Veronica was ported form the DreamCast to the PS2 and instantly shunned the original Resident Evil games on the PlayStation (one of these kids, the leader of the idiot team of course was only one year younger than me).\\n\\nUnfortunately, my dread became vivid and has stayed vivid onward. Resident Evil is never going to be the unique little adventurous, ultra gory, atmospheric little Alone in the Dark rip-off I remember it as because when a company considers three of the most broken, overly action packed, laughable additions to the series as \\'essential,\\' then something is very wrong. The atmosphere that the Resident Evil that was introduced in 1996 (thirteen years ago) is NEVER coming back and it\\'s all thanks to its so-called sequels that were almost entirely dedicated to nothing but action.\\n\\nSeriously, look at what they have: Resident Evil Code Veronica X, the port of the all ready overly action packed jerk-fest with a John Woo gunslinging Leonardo Dicaprio dork and a one dimensional antagonist with the addition of a character who magically survived the previous games by a continuity error that was later explained in Umbrella Chronicles in that classic five year old \"because I said so\" excuse solely so said character could be the equivalent of The Terminator meets The Matrix.\\n\\nThen there\\'s Resident Evil Outbreak, the first online survival horror game ever made and quite  possibly the worst (second only to Outbreak file #2) with more of those random cameo characters the developers loved so much they had to include them in the game by snapping the continuity in pieces.

But despite hundreds of reviews read and dozens of videos watched:  I have not played the game.\\n\\nSo WHY do I feel I can review this?  ANSWER:  The server issues alone are enough to give the game a 1 star at current time.  Some of those issue will improve, some will remain.  The game also happens to have issues outside this.  Issues agreed on by both sides.  I'll tackle those too.\\n\\nServer issues:\\n1.  Servers being crap on launch week = Horrible, but forgivable.  Code limitations should have been ironed out in beta, and plenty of hardware should have been provided for launch.  Blizzard is NOT a poor indie company that randomly got massive unforseen demand.  Still, things happen.\\n\\n2.  Servers being crap on the following week = WTF.  Again Code should have been stress tested and broken during beta.  If they didn't have enough servers a week gave them plenty of time to set up more.  Blizzard has the money, it just didn't want to spend it.\\n\\n3.  Servers still having regular issues over 2 weeks following launch = No words for this.  Simply unacceptable for a company of its resources and the amount of development time/metrics they had for this.\\n\\n4.  Cannot play single player offline.\\n\\n5.  Server problems further destroy the single player experience.\\n\\n6.  Great, now people are regularly getting hacked playing single player.  Bravo Blizzard.\\n\\nNon-Server Issues:\\n\\n7.  Character customization has been disintegrated.  While this offers a more flexible approach that streamlines and yes simplifies, it nonetheless robs a very important part of the game away from many people.  Also, that streamlining and the old issues could have been fixed within the old system easily.  This lowers replay.  Yes maybe YOU don't have an issue with this but people have spoken.  An overwhelming amount of people DO have an issue with this, minor or major.\\n\\n8.  Items.  Diablo has always had a strong loot basing as well as being fun to play.  Unfortunately the loot distribution and balancing in Diablo 3 is broken atm.  Magic items are better than items of higher rarity because they have an inherently much higher dps.  Items also appear to be more rare in general by far.  This lower also replay.\\n\\n9.  Auction House, for money.  That's ok, that's what the auction house is for right?  Oh, but ya, you're decent items will likely be selling for real world cash now.  At least, once it actually works reliably and they add real money.  So enjoy your poor itemization unless you want to pay.  Because even if you trade 1:1 value on the AH you'll lose 15%+ listing fee to blizzard.  Both sides will :).  Yay?\\n\\n10.  Randomization is very limited:  While mobs randomize fairly well maps themselves randomize only minimally.  This leads to the same layout and very similar experience on additional runs through an area.  This is the 3rd thing that lowers replay.  This is further hurt by many reports that the maps are very similar to D2 maps.\\n\\n11.  Linear.  With the game being linear your forced down a cattle chute constantly being hemmed in and guided in only X direction.  This inability to freely roam even further limits replay.  Combined with the simplified character customization, itemization, and randomization this is a killer that has many people already burning out.  People that would not burn out near as easily on this exact same game otherwise.  This is further hurt by many reports that the maps are very similar to D2 maps.\\n\\n12. Graphics:  When most people including most 5 star reviews note that the graphics are last gen, I believe them.  This isn't as important to me but if graphics being lower than they should be for a game of this calibur bothers you than it's a big strike.\\n\\n13.  Story:  I'm sorry again, most people even 5 star reviews saying the story is forgettable (if they are kind) and horrible (if they are mean) tells me that the story is simply lack luster.  I don't expect epicness in this day and age, but cheese factor and mismanagement of prominent characters is a no no.  Only certain genres like comic books and comedies can pull that off IF DONE RIGHT.\\n\\nOverview:\\n\\nLets disregard the server issues as that would automatically fail this game as a consideration for purchase.  It's assumed these will, eventually (and apparently with the minimum money investment possible) be fixed.  Regardless it's UNFORGIVABLE for a company with the resources of Blizzard and with the testing time/metrics/sales predicitions they had at their disposal.\\n\\nIs this a fun game from everything I know?  Yes.  Will it be worth playing after they get server issues lined out?  Yes.  Is it a AAA title or worth $60?  HECK NO!!  This is the level of polish, length, and quality that you should expect from an Indie developer just putting itself on the map and selling the game at $15-$20.  This is not the level of game expected of a company the size and notoriety of Blizzard.\\n\\nYou'd be way way better off spending your $60 on say, Fallout 1, 2, 3 and New Vegas.  Torchlight + Titan's Quest, and $20 left over for whatever you wish.  ETC.  There are way too many options to justify $60 on this game when you can make far far better use of your money elsewhere with far less frustration and likely more and longer fun.\",\n",
              " '[For a small (but ultimately personally inconsequential) correction and update to my review, skip to the bottom.]\\n\\n<Original review>\\nI wasn\\'t onboard the No Man\\'s Sky hype train prior to release.  I preordered a few days before release date, practically on a whim, just so I could get it quickly and try it out.\\n\\nInitially, I was very pleased with the game:  it felt like early-days Minecraft survival mode on a galactic scale, and I felt almost like I was returning home.  If I would have reviewed it during that honeymoon phase, I would have given it 4, perhaps 5 stars, with caveats.\\n\\nEarlier this evening, after having put several hours of gameplay into the game every day since release, I was determined instead to leave a 3-star review, based on the fact that the game is so very buggy.  I\\'ve had far too many crashes to count.  I once had a crash loop that ended with me crashing 6 times before I could make any progress in the game, and one of those crashes was on the title screen.  Actually, I\\'ve now had two separate crashes while on the game\\'s title screen--I wish I had something witty to say about that, but I don\\'t, so I\\'ll just repeat it:  this game has already crashed twice on the very first screen it opens to, mere seconds after launching.\\n\\nBut everything has changed yet again, and not for the better, hence my current one-star rating.  This game\\'s save feature is very poor:  you can manually save only at certain types of beacons on planets, and otherwise you auto-save when exiting your ship.  This may sound like a good system on the surface, but it\\'s fatally flawed.  You cannot have multiple save files, so if your one save file ever becomes corrupt, or is saved during a certain-death scenario, then it is really and truly game-over.  This is exactly what happened to me.  I landed on a planet, and somehow (unknown to me at the time) my ship landed just inside a mountain (outside of the playable map).  When I exited my ship, my one and only save file was automatically overwritten with my character falling inexorably to their death below the surface of the planet.  Even using my jetpack, I cannot get back above ground or into my ship.  Dying only causes me to (lose my entire inventory, and then) reload and experience the same thing over again.  Manually reloading my game-save (via closing the application and restarting), of course, merely puts me right back at the beginning of the slow, inevitable fall to my character\\'s ultimate doom.\\n\\nOther developers know their games are buggy, and they make concessions:  multiple save-files, staggered auto-saves, etc.  Bethesda comes to mind.  Not so with Hello Games--they couldn\\'t be bothered to safeguard their players\\' character data whatsoever.\\n\\nI am utterly baffled that this game was seemingly not play-tested to any appreciable degree, yet it somehow managed to pass Sony\\'s certification process.  I really, really liked this game after I started playing it, despite all its flaws, despite what we now know to be half-truths (being generous) from the developers prior to release, and despite what inevitably would have become mind-numbing boredom given a few more tens of hours of gameplay.  But this is a completely unfinished, unpolished, and ultimately unplayable piece of software.  It\\'s obvious, given what I did see and enjoy during my time with this game, that the developers have vision and talent--which makes it all the more depressing that none of that matters since they couldn\\'t be bothered work out the bugs prior to shipping (and/or day-one patching) the game.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure who I\\'m more disappointed with:  the developers themselves, or publisher Sony who is obviously complicit in this farce.  This is a full-priced console game, published by the console-maker:  things have obviously gotten very much out of hand.  Until this incident, I have never thought that the entire concept of preordering games might be fundamentally flawed, but now I am determined to be much more careful with my limited gaming funds.  I feel like I got burned on a failed Kickstarter project that was rushed out in an unfinished state.  So I advise anyone similarly concerned to do what I now plan on doing:\\n* Don\\'t preorder games, full stop.\\n* Read reviews from all the major trustworthy gaming publications before making a purchase.\\n* Check reddit threads, Amazon user reviews, and--for high-profile releases--even news articles for mentions of major issues like crashing, bugs, game-ending flaws, etc.\\n* Wait for one or even two major patches (beyond any day-one patch) before pulling the trigger on that sweet new game.\\n\\nI think it\\'s time to move to PC gaming--if my game is going to crash every two hours, it might as well be crashing in glorious 1440p60.  ;-)\\n\\n<end of Original review>\\n\\nEdit:\\n\"A customer\" commented about the multiple auto-saves.  This undocumented (since the game auto-loads your most recent save file from the title screen) feature of having precisely *one* previous save file (not two) does exist:  there are merely \"current\" and \"previous\" save files.  Evidently, upon death, yet another auto-save is triggered:  another bad design choice.  Since both saves are in the exact same spot, this does me no good.  Both my saves are in the exact same doomed location, but minutes apart.  There is no third save file.  My character is still completely unplayable.',\n",

I have played all of the Resistance games and they have all been great. But I purchased this specifically for the online portion. You wouldn't think that if you buy a relatively recent game that the online portion would no longer work. You can only play the campaign so many times before you want to know where you stand amongst your fellow players. If you can't do that, then they have no business selling the product to unsuspecting customers like myself. Given that this game only came out only three years ago, and still on the shelves of many stores, Sony should not be shutting down its servers for this game. To purchase this game brand new and only to find that a major part of it is no longer functional is a total letdown. In an age where publishers such as Activision keep their servers running for games such as Call of Duty: Black Ops that came out four years ago and at the same time still serving the other Call of Duty games from Black Ops to Ghost this should not be. Sony with its deep pocket should be able to continue serving the Resistance community. They chose to go the in the wrong direction and follow businesses such as EA whose business practice has been to nickel and dime customers and give them less for their money. Producing a game such as Resistance 3 and then pulling the plug on the customers is simply, to put it short, bad business practice. As such, I will no longer be purchasing any more Resistance iterations ever again. I am sure that they will do the same to the Resistance 4 customers.\",\n",

This makes something that should be simple, moving around the screens, very frustrating. In one screen after 5 minutes of searching I couldn't find any hot spots that would allow me to move forward into the market area, even though it was evident that it was where I needed to go. So I gave up and started randomly clicking in the screen, which eventually allowed me to move forward, but again, no hot spots to indicate where I could move to from that position. So more random clicking to try to get to one of the booths in the market. After having to do this to move several times the screen finally changed to show the market from a different angle and at that point I had navigational hot spots again. The tiny hot spots also caused a problem with figuring out what items I was supposed to pick up or look at. It caused me to miss several items in certain screens. And in a few cases the hot spot was completely off the item altogether, causing some confusion as to which item I was to pick up or look at. Another annoying problem was that often my character would stand right in front of what I needed to look at or touch.

I\\'ll start off with the fact that they must\\'ve been on something good when they decided not to add 1680x1050 resolution support for this game.  I mean, what the heck is up with that?  I think the majority of gamers will have monitors with a resolution of 1680x1050, in other words, most 20\"-22\" monitors, yet they didn\\'t add support for it.  Hardcore gamers might have a 1920x1080, or 1980x1200 display, but what about those of us who thought 22\" was sufficient enough.  Okay, so I get over that issue by choosing the next resolution down that maintain\\'s a 16:10 aspect ratio (1280x800), so the game looks OK at this resolution, but everyone knows that putting a LCD Monitor on anything other than it\\'s native resolution really makes it quite blurry.\\n\\nOk, so I accept the blurriness but the game doesn\\'t even feel like it\\'s reaching 20FPS.  What\\'s up with that.  I mean, my computer is pretty up to date with all recent technology.  I have not one, but two, GTX 280\\'s in SLi, as well as the newest Phenom II processor released which is at a stock of 3.0GHz, however I have it overclocked to 3.6GHz, and I also have 8GB\\'s of 800MHz DDR2 RAM.  You can imagine this system is quite awesome for Crysis, running usually a minimum of around 40-45PFS, even during intense scenes, and getting up to a max of around 80FPS.  So, why, does Saints Row 2, which is quite inferior in graphics, play at 20FPS and less?  Not sure myself but it sure does suck.  Sure, turning graphics down to low makes it run at a better FPS, but I didn\\'t spend well over $1,500 on my PC to play a game on low settings.  I\\'m quite appalled by this, though I suppose I can\\'t complain seeing as their competitor (Rockstar) didn\\'t do too much better themselves on GTA IV.\\n\\nNow, I regret not getting Saints Row 2 on 360 when it came out, because I was oh so sure the PC version would be amazing...boy was I wrong.  So anyway, those problems out of the way, there are still tons of other glitches and things that others have mentioned before.  One of the most prominent being items popping up out of no where.  Now, I understand it\\'s a huge city, just like in GTA IV, but is it too much to ask for items to \"pop in\" maybe when I\\'m still five feet away instead of about one foot away.\\n\\nAll in all, the two games I were waiting for the most on PC (GTA IV, and Saints Row 2) both failed for me.

Otherwise, great story, great gameplay, and excellent attention to detail.\\n\\n  And if I were reviewing the PS3 version, it would have 5-stars. So, why only one star overall? Well, the first sign of problems came from SecuROM. Now, I hate game pirating as much as anyone, and I think there should be measures in place to prvent it. Invasive, questionably malicious software is not the answer. Second issue comes in the \"Social\" prompt, which plagues the game every time I want to start it up.

Leveling up seems to have little effect as enemies will get you in a state of stun lock if you challenge 2 or more usually.

I just wish someone had shared an HONEST REVIEW containing HALF of the things that I have been through and spared me the TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT and UTTER REGRET that I am now experiencing with this console. Here is a bulleted list of the XBOX One S console\\'s greatest failures:\\n You must wait hours to play a new game  each new game MUST first be installed even if you have the disc. And if you have the disc, it must always be inserted into the console for you to play it even though youve downloaded it onto the console.\\n You must put in all information before you play for the first time, including your credit/debit card info.\\n Like a PC, the console automatically uses a percentage of your space before any game is downloaded. For example, my 2TBs were actually 1.6 TBs available for my use. For the 500 GB consoles, you have just 362 GBs of space available for you to use.\\n Games must be updated often. For example, with Call of Duty  Infinite Warfare (COD), updates occur about every three weeks. Some updates take hours.\\n You must pay $60 a year to interact online or $10/month or $25/three months.\\n Just two months in, the console stopped working because it needed to be directly plugged into an outlet, not a surge protector power strip.\\n There are constant advertisements when you first start the console up and during game play.\\n You CANNOT PLAY ALL RETRO GAMES on this console. There is no backwards compatibility for the first XBOX consoles games. Whereas Nintendo allows you to play its very first games on its consoles, not so with many games from XBOXs earliest console and beyond.\\n If you want extra content for a particular game you must purchase a season pass. This season pass is $40 per game and per profile. So, with COD, if I want to get extra content, I have to pay $40 and that season pass may only be used on MY profile, not my sons. If I want his profile to be able to access the season pass I must pay an ADDITIONAL $40.\\n You may only return games just ONCE in a 12-month period of longer, and even this is said to be a courtesy. So be sure about what you purchase BEFORE you buy  Xbox allows you to preview some games, I suggest you play the game before buying it.\\n Xbox has the worst customer service of any console that I have ever owned  and I have owned several different consoles. They keep me on hold for half an hour or so on MOST occasions. They must send verification codes to service you and sometimes the codes NEVER arrive. They tell you one thing and you find that they are lying but they never admit that they\\'re lying, of course.\\n Poor parental controls are staples of XBOX. Once I tried to check to see if my son had purchased something on his profile and was told that I had no right to his gaming info unless I had his email account name and password.\\n\\n7/12/17 Wanted to add that after you change your \"gamertag\" once, it costs $10 to do so again. Just a PATHETIC console. BY FAR the WORSE console I could ever IMAGINE being produced. Just awful.\\n\\nThe goal of this review is to help people to understand just what they are getting when they make this purchase. I was patient with this console, and so by the time I faced the FACT that XBOX is NOT the console for my family, Id had this console for well over three months and so all I can do is trade it in. However, trade-in costs are very low: I paid almost $450 for my XBOX One S and can only trade it in for less than HALF that amount - $179. The 30 or 40 games that I paid $80 each for are now worth all of $5 and $10. The LONE good thing about the console is the graphics. But the bad outweighs even that BY FAR. I say skip XBOX One in any form (S or X)  get a Nintendo Switch instead!',\n",
              " \"1. EA still refuses to enable Widescreen support for its non-sport, non-console titles despite Widescreen monitors becoming more and more mainstream.  Nasty hacks/workarounds are necessary - for BF2 I spent nearly 4 hours just making the game look right and quit resetting resolution on my Widescreen. Even then - it is not as good looking as real widescreen support.\\n\\n2. EA charges $50 and then as part of the EULA (End User License Agreement) requires that you consent to the display of in-game ads, and installation of spyware/malware which collects your surf habits in order to play online.  I would rather not have a bright neon display selling Coca Cola in a post-apocalyptic future.  Does not fit the setting.  Just an attempt by a greedy publisher to gain money at the expense of, not by helping its customers in enjoying the product.\\n\\n3. EA leaves bugs that have existed since BF2 in-game, and on release this game has been buggy and patches are few and far between.  If its support of BF2 is any indication - gamers will be disappointed in that patches generally break/unbalance things rather than fixing reported problems.\\n\\nOn a positive note (to earn its one-star) is that the new Titan mode is pretty harrowing and exciting... assuming you are actually able to find a stable server and your system doesn't crash your client randomly.\\n\\nI for one am boycotting EA titles until customer grievances are redressed appropriately.  Withour your customers - no advertising company will see a point in paying to have their ads in-game.\",\n",

              " 'The Star rating above for \"fun\" above should read ZERO stars. Sorry. My bad.\\n\\nI never write reviews for products I have never even tried--unless something that is relevant to other potential buyers prevents me from trying or owning it, in which case a review is necessary to inform potential buyers. That is the case with Red Alert 3, where the Draconian copy protection issue has indeed prevented me from purchasing a game that I had looked forward to owning with nothing but joyful anticipation for a long, long time--until the day it was released, and EA Games insulted my dignity.\\n\\nIn a world where so many people are quick to give up their dignity in favor of \"security\", \"comfort\", and in this case, the ability to play a video game, I have no choice but to boycott Red Alert 3 and all other EA Games products.\\n\\nThe executives at EA games have never met me. Why then do they assume that I go to work each day to earn money, spend a large sum of that money on one of their video games, and then GIVE what I just paid for away to thousands of people whom I\\'ve never even met on the internet? For that matter, why do they assume that I would ever know HOW to do something like this, if I wanted to? This is an insult to my dignity, and an overestimation of my technical skills, for no good reason.\\n\\nFurthermore, calling those lawbreakers who DO copy software \"pirates\" is a profound insult to every victim of real PIRATES throughout history--people who have been disfigured, raped, murdered, and sold into slavery. I\\'m sorry, but calling a paying customer a potential \"pirate\" is far more of an injury to me, than enduring the \"suffering\" of never owning a game that I otherwise would have gladly purchased at full price.\\n\\nLet your own conscience be your own guide. But make no mistake about it--the DRM issue with Red Alert 3 IS relevant, and it IS grounds for boycotting all EA Games products. Not only has EA Games totally ruined this gaming experience for me, but they have even corrupted my memory of fun and comradery that I enjoyed playing previous versions of Command & Conquer with my friends over the years. EA Game executives have taken so very much away from us. Why then would anyone who possesses even a shred of self-worth even consider purchasing another one of their products?\\n\\nI give this product 0 stars, because the manufacturer has created conditions that provide zero pleasure from this product.',\n",
              " \"Most XBOX users are used to controls that were developed with halo and have now pretty much carried over to most games on the market.  Move with left stick, look with the right.  Well, this game is a blast to the (frustrating) past.  You move around with one stick, then have to hold a button in order to switch to aim mode (which takes a whole second), and you use the same stick now to aim, while you stand still and get beat up by zombies.  It takes a few seconds just to shoot a guy standing 6 inches in front of you.  Don't even get me started with the horrible AI your partner has...\\n\\nI think fans of the franchise will love this game, controls are similar to the (4 year old) resident evil 4 game.  For someone new to the series, I urge you to try the demo before forking a lot of money at this game.  If you can get used to the controls, it's a decent game (not great), and pretty short, but getting used to those controls can be torture.\",\n",

It has a button that changes the DPI scaling, I personally don't find the light to be too bright, and the wiring sheath is nice woven material. My only complaint (and why I took a star), my cable arrived and it looked like a rodent got a hold of the cable sheathing, so I have random thread pulls all over the place. It doesn't affect the mouse at all it seems, so I assume the internal cabling is fine. The packaging was also very nice. All in all, I would recommend this to someone I know.\\n\\nUPDATE: 6 Months Later\\nThe mouse still works for most part, but the left mouse button has a tendency to double click on it's own. This mouse was on my laptop and underwent light use (mostly turn based games, web browsing, and photoshop). It's a really nice mouse when it's new, but it doesn't seem to hold up well.\",\n",

              " 'What\\'s better than a driving game that makes you constantly close text boxes plastered all over the screen so you don\\'t crash? Yeah. That\\'s what you can expect  with this trash game. Come on EA. You\\'re killing it, I mean, killing your franchise!\\n\\nAnyway...I can\\'t believe what EA has done to destroy this beloved franchise. First off, know that Criterion (Burnout and Hot Pursuit devs) They did not make this game. This atrocity was made by an entity called Ghost. In a nutshell, this game is complete garbage. Oh Criterion, you are missed already... You\\'re better of sticking in a 10 year old NFS game then play this. Read on.\\n\\nI could barely get through this hour of play time.  First issue,  almost everything in this game is recycled from NFS Rivals and I wasn\\'t a big fan of that one either but hey if the gameplay is great? Give it a chance right? But no, like others have mentioned, this is nothing but a copy and paste of Rivals.  Yea EA being EA! The B actors they hired are absolutely detestable and you\\'re forced to listen to their tripe and these cut scenes are so bad I want cringe. You will get sick. Grab the barf bags. There\\'s more videos of atrocious cut scenes than you are actually driving the car. Can we leave videos to youtube and not for video games? Even worse, you can\\'t skip it. The fast and furious rendition attempts to  come into play and you\\'ll laugh listening to these idiots, but the worst part, (nope, you can\\'t skip it).\\n\\nAnyway, when you finally get to drive, you are engulfed with obtrusive text boxes that cover the screen, while you\\'re driving I might add and you have to constantly press B to get rid of it before you crash. After about 15 closures of text books I didn\\'t want to read and constantly being interrupted, the driving finally comes into play. At first glance, I have to say, it\\'s probably the prettiest night time driving I\\'ve ever seen.  The cars are purty, very well detailed, and nice cosmetical damage. But...\\n\\nThe good stops there.  The driving itself is borderline bad. The drifting? Um, I\\'ll say this, \"what drifting?\" There is no drifting that I could see or pull out, I felt completely out of control of my ride.  I\\'ve felt better handling on Rad Racer for the NES.  And of course, no surprise. No Dash view hurts too, I love seeing the old dashboard in the old NFS games, none of that here. The game is apparently online online ONLY and I of course was having server issues geting into a game too.  Network lag was HORRIBLE and I kept glitching out back to the beginning of a race. I got booted out of a mission right in the middle of the game, and I just had to wait to go back.  Okay, I\\'m done. Thanks for the beta demo and calling it a complete game.\\n\\nJust a note. I only played the XBOX One trial but I was originally planning on getting it for ps4, but I assume the ps4 version will be nearly identical.',\n",
